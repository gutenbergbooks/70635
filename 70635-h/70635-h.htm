<h2 class="nobreak">ABOUT THE PLAY.</h2>

</div>

<p>The first requisite in a play is <i>action</i>, after that should
be found as much novelty of incident and freshness of
dialogue, combined with originality in character study,
as the author can contrive to get together in these days
when apparently nothing is wholly new. These plays
are intended primarily for <i>representation</i>.</p>

<p>These explanations are made because the purpose
of a previous volume of my plays, issued without preface,
appeared to have been misunderstood in a few
instances.</p>

<p>Public approval, whether it be an infallible guide or
not, in matters pertaining to print, is at least encouraging,
and this leads me to say that of my earlier plays
there have been sold in paper covers <i>three hundred and
twenty thousand copies</i>, besides an edition in cloth.</p>

Baltimore <i>Sun</i>, mos’ ever since de creation I ’low.

My poor ole mommy couldn’t read nothin’ but de wrapper,

Topp he hates togs already fery much. He vas a mighty
gweer man, an’ he gets no better, aint it; he say to me

yoost keep silence; dot silence was embarrassed, so I
said a little sharp, “Vere you get some twins if you
please, Mr. Topp?” Dot man was awful curious, ven
I haf temper he haf none, sometimes, and sometimes

an’ my fater oont uncle was twins; my poor brudder an’
me was twins, an’ I’m goin’ to have some twins to run
my pisness and pack oysters.” I yoost thought I’d fall
in a heap. I guessed dot man was talkin’ out of his head
alretty; I could say not one wort, but he turned round
an’ walked out. Dot was de piggest puzzle about dem
twins. So yesterday, at breakfast, he say sudden like,
“Tuppletam, I’m goin’ to advertise for dose twins.”</p>

I’ll sell him the dogs or break a trace trying. Lucky
for me I’m on the road most of the time. I think he

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> But, madam, allow me to explain—I beg you
will not be hasty, stay—there she goes—(<i>She exits in
dudgeon. L.</i>) (<i>To <span class="smcap">Tick</span>.</i>) This is disgraceful, sir!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> I quite agree with you, and at your age too.
Now why do you prefer a blonde? Brunettes are more to
my taste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>In towering passion.</i>) Your taste? Blonde!
Brunette! I have expressed no choice, you impertinent
coxcomb. Why don’t you go? Where <i>is</i> that niggro?
If he doesn’t kick you down stairs, I will. (<i>Going to
bell.</i>)</p>

what can I do for you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Angie.</span> I called in answer to your advertisement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Calming down.</i>) Hum! yes. (<i>Aside.</i>) Confound
it, which does she mean? (<i>To <span class="smcap">Angie</span>.</i>) Be seated.

<p><span class="smcap">Angie.</span> Thank you! (<i>Seats herself chair L.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) Typewriter or dog fancier?</p>

(<i>To <span class="smcap">Angie</span>.</i>) May I ask, do you take readily?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Angie.</span> (<i>Confused.</i>) Why, sir, I—yes—that is, my

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) Oho!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Confused. Admires her.</i>) I quite agree

you <i>rapid</i>?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Angie.</span> (<i>Rising offended.</i>) Sir!</p>

She doesn’t catch on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Brushing <span class="smcap">Tick</span> away. Aside.</i>) It must be
twins, then. (<i>To <span class="smcap">Angie</span>.</i>) Write full particulars, give

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> And be sure to name the sire. Strain is
everything in—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> You are in the presence of a lady, sir. Conduct
yourself accordingly, or I shall hold you responsible.
(<i>Pushes him aside.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> You don’t play <i>that</i> game on <i>me</i>! I’m not
responsible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> A correct observation, on my life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> (<i>Getting between them.</i>) Don’t bother me.
This is my customer. (<i>Pulls <span class="smcap">Topp</span> away C.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Desisting.</i>) To be sure, there is a lady present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> That there is a lady present, a <i>young</i> lady!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Glaring at him.</i>) I shan’t forget it. I need
no lessons in manners from you, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> I was only going to say that fighting is rude,

(<i>Rings bell violently.</i>) A niggro is the most aggravating

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Bows and leads way for <span class="smcap">Angie</span>, going L.</i>) I

<p><span class="smcap">Gin.</span> Yis, sah (<i>Starts L. <span class="smcap">Angie</span> and <span class="smcap">Tick</span> following</i>).</p>

(<i>Takes <span class="smcap">Tick</span> by collar and pulls him back.</i>) Don’t think
you shall escape so easily. I shall hold you accountable,

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> You don’t go just yet, young man, I have

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> (<i>Goes up R.</i>) He recognizes me at last. My

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Very well. Now what do you mean, sir, by
coming into my house in this way, poking into my letters,
listening to my private affairs and taking the

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) He doesn’t know me. I’ll bluff a

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> No, your humor is bad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gin.</span> Wy dat gemmen left two kids in de yard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Goats on my lawn! They’ll ruin all the
shrubbery. Of all things I detest a goat. First we
were beset by a legion of dogs, now we are threatened
with goats. This is no menagerie. Put them out at
once, at once I say, before they ruin the plants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gin.</span> But massa—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Go immediately or I’ll thrash you. (<i>Picks

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> Old family retainer, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Yes, and like most heirlooms of no value
whatever. He is one of the fixtures in the family
along with our traditions. His grandfather was servant
of my grandfather; his mother was my nurse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> It is very commendable of you, sir, to bear
with his failings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Well, I doubt it sometimes. But as I said,
he is a fixture along with our tradition of twins; twin
brothers have been at the head of the firm of Topp &amp;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
Topp for three generations. When my poor brother died
five years ago the line was broken. Now, alas, it is
necessary to resort to <i>adoption</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> Very sad, sir, to see an honored old house

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Your sentiments are very commendable, very!
But, hang it, sir, you make too sure of your premise.
I am on the verge, but not the verge of extinction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> What verge, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>With sudden gayety.</i>) My boy, it makes me
so good natured to think of it, and your inquisitiveness
is so very refreshing that, by Jove, I’ll gratify it. I’m
going to marry that young lady.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) Well, he has assurance. A rival!
(<i>To <span class="smcap">Topp</span>.</i>) I admire your taste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Aint I a lucky chap? Gad, I feel twenty-five.
I think fifty-five is not very old, what do you say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> Not so old as seventy-five.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Growls.</i>) Seventy-five is not in question,
sir. (<i>To himself.</i>) Ah! I’m in luck. That little
blonde (or brunette, as the case maybe) is very pretty!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) I’ll head him off! (<i>To <span class="smcap">Topp</span>.</i>) May
I suggest, sir, that your acquaintance with the young
lady is rather brief.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> A fig for your suggestion. She’ll come
around all right. By the way, your alleged business
seems to consist chiefly in poking your nose into other
people’s affairs. I have suggested several times that
you take your leave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> (<i>Bowing.</i>) At your pleasure. I’m waiting to

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

man. (<i>Starts to D. F. to pull bell. Sees <span class="smcap">Gin.</span> and

you a thousand times not to stand listening?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gin.</span> An ’bout ’leven hundred times never to speak

<p><span class="smcap">Gin.</span> Dat’s de man wot fotched de kids.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>To <span class="smcap">Spratt</span>, with temper.</i>) Did you leave
any kids on my lawn! sir? That is actionable. I’ll
prosecute you. I’ll see if there’s any law for making
bedlam out of a quiet neighborhood, and turning
objectionable animals loose on one’s lawn. Potts, take
away those kids.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spratt.</span> (<i>Angrily.</i>) Kids? How dare you allude
to Grover Cleveland Spratt and Benjamin Harrison
Spratt in that way?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Your nomenclature is ridiculous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spratt.</span> I beg to differ. Not knowing your politics,
I thought I’d please you one way or the other. You
can change whichever name you don’t like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> I don’t like either. I am a Prohibitionist!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spratt.</span> Then change both!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Change both! I’ll have them drowned,
Potts, do you hear that? Drown them!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spratt.</span> I overlook your insult. To return to

<p><span class="smcap">Spratt.</span> Yes, and I’ve a mind to chastise you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Chastise <i>me</i>! Don’t you try it. (<i>Feint of

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> Josiah, do you think there is anything in
that advertisement in the <i>Sun</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Which advertisement, Sophronia? There are
several hundred of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> I mean the one about wealthy gentleman
who wants to adopt twins. Is there anything in it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> A tale of disappointed aspiration, probably.
A gentleman, without doubt, whose taste runs to twins
and who has been reduced to the necessity of advertising
for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> But what do you think of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> For my part, I don’t approve of twins.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> Don’t you think he is a crank?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Very likely! A crank is an individual whose
ideas differ from yours and mine and who takes no pains
to conceal the fact.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> Do you think he’s all right? (<i>Hands him
paper.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> (<i>Looking at advertisement.</i>) He says high connections,
honorable gentleman, etc. I guess he’s what
he claims to be. He must be, he says so himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> The main thing is, is he <i>rich</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Yes, that’s the main thing. Honor, culture,
family, are minor considerations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> Josiah, don’t be sarcastic. You always try
to twist my meaning round. I’m going to have Mrs.
Twiggs-Knott apply at once. It would be so nice for
Twiggsie and Dixie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Why not try to get this estimable single party
of high connections to marry one of our daughters?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> Josiah, how you talk!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> That is a better scheme. If he takes Amelia
he gets the twins thrown in, and if he takes Angie—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> For shame, Josiah, one would think that we
were scheming for our dear children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Oh, no! perish the thought! (<i>Knock at

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> At your age, sir, to be a father to budding
innocence is indeed a joy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Surprised.</i>) A father! Yes, yes, no doubt
you are right. (<i>Aside.</i>) Am I old Nestor himself, I wonder!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) That’s better! (<i>To <span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span></i>) Delightful,
madam, delightful!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> To hear innocence lisp in stammering accents
is indeed—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Ecstatic, madam, I assure you. But I draw
the line at stammering—does she stammer?</p>

came—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Angie.</span> (<i>Bows bashfully; surprised.</i>) Sir, I do not
understand this sudden call.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Of course not. Explanations will follow duly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> (<i>With meaning look.</i>) A friendly call my
dear, and a little business mingled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Yes, business first and pleasure after.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> I dislike the word “business” but—perhaps
sentiment should cut no figure in such matters. (<i>Aside.</i>)
Mercenary wretches!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Graciously.</i>) No, indeed. I assure you though
it may have originated in a mistake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Angie.</span> A mistake!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Great events have sprung from little misunderstandings.
To make a long story short, Mr. Twiggs,
I have come directly to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> (<i>Puzzled.</i>) To him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> And why not to him, madam!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> Very proper, sir. You have acted in a business-like

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Both!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> Shocking! how very strange!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Hu’m! as I was saying—(<i>To <span class="smcap">Mrs. Twiggs</span>.</i>)
And you, madam, since I take it you should be consulted
also, where do we find ourselves? (<i>Pause, they all
look at one another.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> Proceed, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Yes, we are all ears.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> I was about to suggest that the presence of
your daughter may be embarrassing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> Oh, never mind her. She is used to hearing
all such matters discussed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Starting.</i>) Ah, indeed! Such matters—(<i>Aside.</i>)
I don’t like this. A trap—(<i>A pause.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> Continue, my dear sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Madam, I do not agree with you. I had the
pleasure of seeing your daughter but once, and I wish
to satisfy myself a little concerning certain matters. In
short, a <i>private</i> interview is the proper thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> Mercy me!—Oh, I begin to understand. He
wants to talk to <i>you</i>, Josiah. How stupid you are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Exactly! How stupid we are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> What is the man driving at? (<i>Suddenly to
<span class="smcap">Topp</span>.</i>) Who are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Yes, as a mere formality it might be well
to know your name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Since your daughter has already called on
me perhaps she will do me the honor of an introduction.
(<i>Aside.</i>) She’s a little angel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> My daughter has called on you? Is this
so, Angie dear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Angie.</span> Yes, mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> In answer to an advertisement?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Angie.</span> Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> (<i>Hysterically.</i>) Oh, rash girl! This is terrible!
This is the wretch who advertised for a young
lady for private secretary. (<i>Sarcastically.</i>) Tall, blonde
preferred, etc., etc. (<i>Here describes <span class="smcap">Angie</span>.</i>) Oh, silly
child! Oh, horrid wretch! Josiah, <i>will</i> you endure
this insult and never say one word or lift a hand in
defense of your fireside.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Never mind the fireside, it’s all right. What
does the gentleman want?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> What does he want? he’s a monster!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Angie.</span> (<i>Remonstrating.</i>) Oh, mother!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Astounded.</i>) Madam, one word—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> (<i>Tragically.</i>) Wretch! Not a word! My

Who are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Bless my soul, our dog-fancier again! Stick

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> I wont!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> We’ll see about that. (<i>Business of pushing

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Why bless me if he doesn’t mean it. Well,
I didn’t graduate in a university for nothing. I know
a little of the manly art. (<i>Hits <span class="smcap">Twiggs</span> and knocks him

but you’re welcome to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> (<i>Recovering.</i>) Don’t come on again! My

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> (<i>Rushes between them.</i>) Don’t hurt him, Josiah.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> You have broken my window.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Yes, madam, <i>my</i> window.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> (<i>Screams.</i>) Mercy me, it’s Mr. Topp, our

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> What! Mr. Topp, of Topp &amp; Topp?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>With great dignity.</i>) Yes, sir, Cadwalader
Topp, sole proprietor of Topp &amp; Topp, oyster packers.
My card, sir. (<i>Hands card.</i>) You have treated me with

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> (<i>Pulling at <span class="smcap">Twiggs’</span> coat.</i>) Josiah, we are undone.
Run and apologize.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Apologize, never! Now, sir, (<i>Following
<span class="smcap">Topp</span>.</i>) I challenge you to a round outside. (<i><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Angie.</span> Mother, please be quiet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> I’ll have you up for assault and battery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Try it if you dare.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> Three cheers for the old man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> And what’s more, you shall repair that window!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Never!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> Josiah, do be quiet. You are so indiscreet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> We’ll see about it. Take my word for that.
You have the form of lease which reads “All repairs at
expense of tenant.” And now Mr. Twiggs, since you

(<i>Going R.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> Please, sir, don’t be hasty! This is all a
mistake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> I quite agree in that sentiment. Madam a great
mistake, but not too late to mend it. (<i>Going R.</i>) I withdraw
my proposal for your daughter’s hand. (<i>Exit R.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> Daughter’s hand! Oh! oh! support me Josiah.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Underdone, you mean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> That’s just like you, Josiah, to perpetrate
small-beer witticisms over the misfortunes of your own
family. Now you are actually laughing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Do you want me to cry, Sophronia?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> No, it’s a man’s place to be brave and assert
his rights.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> I was too brave, my dear. (<i>Looks at broken
window, all laugh.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> <i>I</i> shall not let him withdraw so easily. I
shall write and say his proposition is considered favorably.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Angie.</span> Oh, mama! How indelicate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> Pooh, my child, you know nothing about
such matters. Even delicacy may be overdone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Angie.</span> I detest him, mama.</p>

Madam, your precious child has indeed escaped a wolf.
He is an old mormon, or worse, I’ll bet ten dollars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> He’s worth millions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> And yet he wont pay for that window.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> Josiah, it is painful to think how you let

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> But you are a stranger, you do not understand
the case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> I understand it perfectly. I shall call him
to account. I will demand an apology; if he refuses, I
will—by jingo, I will challenge him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T-K.</span> And you said one word for them and a
dozen for yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Angie.</span> Now, sister, how can you? I said all I could
for your boys.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T-K.</span> Indeed! What did you say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Angie.</span> Oh, it was too funny! There was a young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
gentleman there by the name of Tick, and they talked
so many things that they got me all confused so I can’t
remember what I did say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T-K.</span> Artless creature!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Angie.</span> (<i>With dignity.</i>) Mrs. Twiggs-Knott, may I
ask what you mean by that epithet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T-K.</span> I mean you are greatly mistaken. It was
<i>me</i> that Mr. Topp came to see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Angie.</span> <i>You!</i> Impossible! Didn’t I read love in his
eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T-K.</span> (<i>With sneer.</i>) Oh, if it has come to reading
love in his eyes, we may consider it settled. That sort
of reading can be done just as well with the eyes closed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Angie.</span> Possibly, I’ve had no experience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T-K.</span> Well, you are in a fair way to get it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Angie.</span> Spare your comments. The teacher need not
be a third party.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T-K.</span> He said he would be sure to write to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Angie.</span> And to me, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T-K.</span> He took special interest in me and said
he was very, very sorry he could not do something at
once, or words to that effect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Angie.</span> He took my address.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T-K.</span> Address! That was a matter of form.
He expressed great regret that he could not devote more
time to my matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Angie.</span> Expressed <i>regret</i>! (<i>Archly.</i>) Well he exhibited
great pleasure at my call.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T-K.</span> Pooh, common politeness only. For me
it was a deep interest. I read it in his—(<i>Stops suddenly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Angie.</span> Eyes? Ha, ha, ha, you are taking lessons,
too, sister. Well, I called within two minutes after you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
left and if his countenance expressed any sentiment it
was plainly bad humor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T-K.</span> Which your smile immediately thawed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Angie.</span> Indeed it did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T-K.</span> Angie, I think you are real mean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Angie.</span> Well, sister, seriously, I don’t want him, you
are welcome to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T-K.</span> (<i>Brightening.</i>) I <i>know</i> he called for me
and, oh, such a horrid mistake. I shall die. (<i>Screams.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> What is it my dear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T-K.</span> Mr. Topp called for me instead of Angie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> No! You don’t say. Why do you think so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T-K.</span> He told me that he was coming, or at
least would write.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> What a dreadful misunderstanding! We
are all ruined! (<i>Screams.</i>) Josiah! Come! Quick!
Where is that man?</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> hastily.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> We are ruined!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> We have been ruined so often, my dear, that
I rather enjoy it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> Now, Josiah, don’t try to be funny. When
you try to be funny the effect is painful. Husband, do
you realize the calamity that has befallen us?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Yes, I guess you mean the window.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> The window—indeed! Oh, the obtuseness of
men! Mr. Topp has proposed for the hand of the wrong
girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> No! Is that all you can say? You never
say anything but <i>no</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> My dear, <i>no</i> is a very convenient little particle
to calk chinks in a colloquy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> This can never be repaired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> The window?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> Don’t talk eternally of that window. The
match!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Exactly! the match of course! Sophronia, I
suggest we try welding. The soft solder of diplomacy
may result in the union called matrimony.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> Girls, do you hear that? Never marry a man
who thinks he is funny. It is an incurable vice that
breaks out at unexpected moments, to your utter confusion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> But, ladies, I protest I am not funny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> We agree there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Can you not distinguish between a well-turned
sentence and—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> A small pun. Josiah, if you were a man of
action you would do something instead of asking useless
questions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> I don’t care to go into action twice in the
same day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T-K.</span> (<i>Groans.</i>) I think it’s a shame!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Angie.</span> It’s funny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> (<i>Severely.</i>) So your father appears to think.
What is to be done? That is the question.</p>

proposals.</p>

see him at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> Duty and the happiness of your child call
you. (<i>Authoritatively.</i>) Go!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> I prefer not to tackle him again to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> All right, I go myself. Between two evils
we must choose the best. I will go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> My dear, I wont allow it. We must choose
the worst. I’ll beard the—that proverb is stale—I’ll

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T-K.</span> Oh, I’m in such a state! What if Angie
is right after all and Mr. Topp is in love with <i>her</i>?
(<i>Sighs.</i>) Ah, well! I <i>did</i> think he admired me and then
his asking me to write about dear Twiggsie and Dixie.
But I just couldn’t write <i>all</i> about them, they’re so
charming. To tell him in a confidential way will be
much nicer. Pa is sure to bungle matters. Men always
do. I must see Mr. Topp and make sure of this golden<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>

perhaps he wouldn’t want to adopt twins. No, of course
not. How absurd. Oh, dear, what a complication!

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> Yes, peesness?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T-K.</span> <i>Very</i> urgent business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> Urchent! Dot will be of great importance,
aint it? Mr. Topp comes sometimes home pretty guick,
an’ sometimes he comes later. He haf his lunch at one
o’clock. What was your peesness? Some togs?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T-K.</span> Dogs! No, indeed! I have business
of great importance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> Togs was of much importance by some
peoples. One woman brought a leetle tog under each
arm. When I told her Mr. Topp would kill tem she got
mat like fury an’ says she, I yoost like to see him try dot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T-K.</span> I don’t like dogs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> Den you yoost agree mit Mr. Topp. He
can’t pear mit togs an’ goats an’ such animals like dot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T-K.</span> I admire his taste! Oh, I think he is
such a fine gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> Lady, he is fine like golt. He has one heart

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T-K.</span> Oh, go on, I love to hear you talk of him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> So? Well, he was gweer sometimes. He
got a notion of twins?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T-K.</span> (<i>With interest.</i>) Yes?</p>

Tuppletam, we must haf some twins.” For tree days I
tink about dot an’ by myself I make nodings out. Dot
was a Chinese puzzle. Mr. Topp he say one day he
was goin’ to <i>adopt</i> dem twins. Den it was all glear an’
I say what a kindness in dot heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T-K.</span> I could listen to you all day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> Ach, so? Shall you listen all day? Come

but I am. Ah! what a face! What a figure! And that
smile! Yes, Topp, old boy, you’re in love again for the
first time in twenty years. The sensation isn’t bad
either. In fact, it is delightful. I feel young again.
Didn’t I knock that old chap out easily. Stay! that was
<i>her</i> father, that was an indiscretion. I must apologize
handsomely. But “the course of true love never did
run smooth.” I think I’m no bad match. (<i><span class="smcap">Dubbledam</span>

do you want?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> Eeef you please, Mr. Topp, I knock two
three times already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Very well. What is it?</p>

call again or write.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Looks up, recognizes her, comes down C.</i>) Oh,
so I did! (<i>With decision.</i>) But I said <i>write</i>. I have no
time for interviews.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T-K.</span> Writing is impossible. Twiggsie and
Dixie are <i>so</i> charming. I’m sure if you only saw them!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) Dogs again! (<i>Curtly.</i>) Madam I

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Annoyed.</i>) The same old story. You’ve called

I beg your pardon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T-K.</span> Oh, pray don’t mention it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> I beg a thousand pardons. How ludicrous, to

I do not think now of adopting twins!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> Vot! No twins alretty!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> No, Dubbledam. I’ve changed my mind.
In short, I might as well tell you now to put the house in
order. I’m going to marry!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> Marry! Mine cracious!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T-K.</span> (<i>Starts.</i>) Marry! Then I suppose I may
at least—(<i>Embarrassed, stops.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Congratulate me? Yes. The prettiest little

I congratulate you. I—yes, I hope you’ll be happy.</p>

wish you a very good day, madam. (<i>Exeunt <span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> and

Pshaw, who cares! Love rises superior to misunderstandings.

<p><span class="smcap">Gin.</span> (<i>Announces.</i>) Mr. Twiggs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> I beg pardon for the interruption. You

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Coming forward.</i>) Mr. Twiggs, I owe you an

censurable, I assure you. Do you forgive me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> Of course! It <i>was</i> a little brusque, but
nobody was hurt. You took me by surprise, but I’ll
put on the gloves with you any time that suits your convenience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Grasping his hand.</i>) Don’t think of such a
thing, sir. At your age—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> At my age—do you think I’m as ancient

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> I beg pardon! (<i>Confused, aside.</i>) I must be
more guarded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> All right, Topp! (<i>Aside.</i>) I’ll have to play

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Then, to proceed to the point directly. I’m

your daughter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> Exactly!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> It is understood?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> None that I know of.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Thank you. Excuse my apparent haste. You

will take care of themselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> The preliminaries were soon settled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> Yes, though I happen to think of one preliminary
that might be a little clearer. Which one of my
daughters do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Astonished.</i>) What! Which one (<i>Pause</i>)—have
you several?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> Only two, sir. Will you be kind enough to
specify the lady by name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Puzzled.</i>) Let me see! (<i>Looks for note book

(<i>Aside.</i>) Another break, hang it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> You are mistaken, sir, it is the confusion of
love. You said you could appreciate a lover’s feelings.
(<i>Can’t find note book.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> Of course, beg pardon. (<i>Aside.</i>) If I succeed
I’ll be the first on record.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> Of course, why didn’t we think of that sooner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Laughs.</i>) Certainly! She knew it before I
did, the sly puss.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> But hold on! What if she won’t tell? Don’t
you think it would be rather embarrassing for the lady
to speak her mind first?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Quite right you are. Now I have it, I’ll describe
her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> That is a practical idea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> She is tall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> They are both tall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> And good looking!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> (<i>With slight bow.</i>) Our family is noted, sir,
for the comeliness of it’s female members.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Her smile is simply enthralling!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> Exactly! But allow me to remark that you
are a single man and do not know the power of the female
smile as a social lever, especially when a new bonnet or
a new gown is its focal point. You must try again, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Hesitates.</i>) Her eye is like the gazelle’s.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> Gad, sir, yours <i>is</i> a bad case. Allow me to
suggest that you name the color of the aforesaid optic,
or better still the color of her hair? By the way have
you a lock of her hair?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> A lock of her hair on one day’s acquaintance!
(<i>Remonstrates.</i>) Oh, sir, you wrong your child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> Excuse me, no offense, but a plain old father

of an affair like this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> No, of course not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> Oh, yes, some call it <i>red</i>! I’ll speak to
Angie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Eagerly.</i>) Angie, that’s her name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> And, as lovers are usually impatient, I’ll
attend to the matter immediately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

you out myself, sir. Good day. (<i>They shake hands.

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> I called in relation to a matter of mutual interest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> You are the individual who called before and
spent an hour, on pretense of business, in listening to my
private affairs and reading my letters. Your interest in
my affairs is altogether too great.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> From whom, pray?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> You know well enough who. She declines the
honor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Do not speak in riddles. To whom do you refer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> To Miss Twiggs, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Furious.</i>) Why you monkey, who are you?
Her father has just been here. (<i>Getting angrier.</i>) You
are insulting. I’ll have Potts kick you down stairs.

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Sneeringly.</i>) My rival! That man! Fiddlesticks!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spratt.</span> He has traduced you, sir. He called you
names. I’ll leave it to Mr. Ginger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gin.</span> (<i>Grinning.</i>) Yis, sah.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> What did he say, Potts? (<i><span class="smcap">Tick</span> tries to catch
<span class="smcap">Ginger’s</span> eye. Pantomime of giving coin. <span class="smcap">Topp</span> severely.</i>)
Now look here, Ginger! What ails you? What did he
say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gin.</span> I’m tryin’ to think of the word. It’s powerful
long. A deceptive octagon, sah, that’s it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Eh! What’s that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gin.</span> A—de—um—that’s what I said.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spratt.</span> A decrepit octogenarian, that was the epithet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gin.</span> Dat’s it! A decreptive octogon—narium.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>To <span class="smcap">Tick</span>.</i>) Why, sir, this is infamous! This
is actionable. The law sir—bother the law’s delays.
I’ll call you out, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> To take a drink?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Thunders.</i>) To take a drink? No, sir. To
the field of honor, sir, at thirty paces.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> (<i>Starts.</i>) That’s a pretty small field.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Say forty paces then, I’m not particular. I
demand satisfaction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> I always try to give my customers satisfaction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Confound your customers. (<i><span class="smcap">Tick</span> laughs heartily.</i>)
What are you laughing at, sir? (<i><span class="smcap">Tick</span> laughs
again. Shaking his fist at <span class="smcap">Tick</span>.</i>) Don’t provoke me!
I cannot answer for the consequences. Commercial
affairs have no place in an affair of honor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> My customers tell me that frequently. (<i>Laughs.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> May the devil take your customers from first
to last. (<i><span class="smcap">Tick</span> laughs immoderately. <span class="smcap">Topp</span> furious.</i>) If
you don’t stop your laughing, I’ll knock every tooth out
of your head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spratt.</span> His conduct is very ungentlemanly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> In the extreme! In the extreme! I can’t fight
<i>him</i>. He is no gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) Indeed! I’ll try a bluff. (<i>To <span class="smcap">Topp</span>.</i>)
I insist on fighting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> You insist! I’ll accommodate you, sir, if the
code will possibly allow it. To begin, sir, you are in trade.
Old honorable house, may I ask? (<i><span class="smcap">Tick</span> laughs.</i>) You
are laughing again, young man. To judge by your conduct
the house is scarcely respectable. (<i><span class="smcap">Tick</span> laughs immoderately.
<span class="smcap">Topp</span> jerks off coat.</i>) Now, sir, take your choice.
Stop laughing or be knocked down without ceremony.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> I beg pardon! My laugh goes off very easy.
It’s a hair-trigger laugh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Don’t let it go off again. I warn you. Head
of house or member of firm?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> Neither! Traveling salesman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Traveling salesman! That would never do.
(<i>To <span class="smcap">Spratt</span>.</i>) Would it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spratt.</span> Never!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> But I insist!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>To <span class="smcap">Spratt</span>.</i>) He insists. Is there no way of
accommodating him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spratt.</span> I suggest you make him give up all pretentions
to the young lady and then boot him out of
your house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> Boot me out of the house. Well, that’s cheek
enough for an office seeker, you puppy!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spratt.</span> Puppy! Dare you call me puppy? I’ll—
(<i>Makes toward <span class="smcap">Tick</span>. <span class="smcap">Topp</span> prevents him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Stay, restrain your impetuosity. Your only
remedy is to call him out after I have done with him. As
for booting him out of the house, no gentleman could
so deport himself toward another gentleman. Do you
think I could stain my honor by kicking him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spratt.</span> No, it would not do. Let the nigger kick
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> Gentlemen, this waiting is a bore. (<i>Theatrically.</i>)
To fight or not to fight, that’s the question.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Permit me one more question. Are you
wholesale or retail?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> Wholesale only.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Ah, that is better! And your house I have
no doubt <i>is</i> of high standing. Doubtless A1 in the books?
(<i><span class="smcap">Tick</span> laughs immoderately. <span class="smcap">Topp</span> advances furiously shaking
his fist at <span class="smcap">Tick</span>.</i>) Mr. Spratt, restrain me, or I <i>will</i>
knock him down, in spite of the code. I see nothing to
laugh at. An affair of honor is a serious affair, I’d have
you understand. Perhaps this is your first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> It is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Then you shall have a new experience. You
may consider it settled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> (<i>Frightened.</i>) Do you insist?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Certainly, sir! Consider it settled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> But, my dear sir, all these objections—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Are waived, sir. Choose your second. Mr.
Spratt, will you favor me by arranging details on my
part?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spratt.</span> With pleasure!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) Good Lord! I’m in for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>To <span class="smcap">Tick</span>.</i>) Call a friend!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> Say the undertaker. I object.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> It is too late to object, sir. Choose your <i>second</i>.
The undertaker will make a good <i>third</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> Are you trying to scare me! I can’t be bluffed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Oh, certainly not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> I’d as soon fight as eat, but—ah—I’ll be magnanimous.
I’ll spare you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spratt.</span> That’s cool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Sir, this is additional provocation. I insist
on fighting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> But think of the loss to your business if you
should fall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Getting angry.</i>) Mr. Spratt hasten the details,
I am anxious to teach this young man a lesson. I suggest
Blackberry Hill. There is no other such spot near
Baltimore. (<i>To <span class="smcap">Tick</span>.</i>) It is a beautiful spot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> I don’t doubt it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> There I had the pleasure of acting as second
for the Hon. Kidwell Kroup in his great duel with Major
Brocklestein. The major winged my man first fire, but
it was a beautiful affair gentlemen, beautiful. A few
years later, I had the pleasure—excuse me for being
personal—of meeting there myself, Col. Hicksby Snodgrass,
C. S. A. And the Colonel wears only one arm
since that hour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> (<i>Groans.</i>) Very cheerful, indeed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Delightful, I assure you. So choose your second
and we’ll have the whole affair over before the authorities
get wind of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> I shall be delighted to hasten matters. (<i>Whispers
aside to <span class="smcap">Ginger</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>To <span class="smcap">Spratt</span>.</i>) Now, my dear sir, I leave all
to you. Use expedition. (<i>To <span class="smcap">Gin.</span></i>) Show the gentlemen
out. (<i>Exeunt <span class="smcap">Spratt</span> and <span class="smcap">Tick</span>, L.</i>) Ah, well this
may be serious after all. But it is only an incident and
the true gentleman lives in an atmosphere of incidents.
I’ll write her. Bless her little heart, honor demands that I
do and dare for her like a knight of old. (<i>Sits at table to
write.</i>) “My dear Miss Twiggs”—No, that is too formal—“My
dear Angie”—how does that sound?—that’s
a little familiar possibly for one day’s acquaintance.
(<i>Tears up sheet of paper with each change.</i>) How about
the <i>my</i>—well I guess I’m sure enough of the <i>my</i>. But
“My dear Angie” is too long. I’ll try “Dear Angie.”
That’s better, but why not make it stronger? Women
feed on compliment and are taken by audacity in love.
As old Horace advised I’ll plunge “in medias res.” So
here goes: “Sweet Angie”—that’s better. But that is
not enough. How very inadequate language is to
portray all the delightful sensations of new born
love. (<i>Thinks.</i>) “Sweet Angie—My Pet”—that’s the
thing—“This will inform you that I cannot see you
again to-day. A little affair” (<i>Pause.</i>) <i>affair</i>—I wonder
if that will alarm her? No, women admire courage—“An
affair of honor requires immediate attention. Shall
see you soon. May I close with a kiss?”—that’s a
little bold—“a sweet, sweet kiss?” There you are,
that’ll please her. “Au revoir and a final sweety—sweety
kiss.” You can’t put too much of the sweet
business into an affair with a young lady. You must
love them distractedly, or you’ll never please them.
(<i>Sighs.</i>) How shall I sign it? Cadwalader Topp is too
formal. I’ll risk it. It sounds more affectionate.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
“Caddie,” that used to be my pet name. While I’m
about it I’ll just say “Your Caddie.” There you are!

and I believe you actually enjoy it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> My dear, I can’t say that I enjoy it so far.
Our walk in search of it has been rather hurried. They

Latter carries case of instruments, which he leisurely unpacks,

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>To <span class="smcap">Tick</span>.</i>) Ah, prompt, I see. Where is your
second?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> He is delayed a little looking for a surgeon.
I expect him momentarily.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> That is unfortunate. Quick work here is the
order. We are liable to interruption from the police.
We have brought a surgeon, Dr. Short.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> Let your man Spratt and Doctor Short arrange
details, I’m indifferent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Haughtily.</i>) This is no place for a display
of generosity, sir. This is very irregular and time is
pressing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spratt.</span> I see no objection to stepping the ground,
for example if Dr. Short will stand for Mr. Tick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Very irregular, very. What do you say, Dr. Short?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. S.</span> (<i>Very formal and dignified.</i>) I coincide, sir.
It is highly irregular, I might add, perhaps, unprecedented.
Had I the pleasure of the acquaintance of
your opponent—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Bowing low.</i>) I beg your pardon! I forget
you were not acquainted! Mr. Tick, I have the pleasure
of introducing Dr. Short. Dr. Short, Mr. Tick.
Mr. Tick, Dr. Short. (<i>They bow.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Short.</span> (<i>Judicially and with great dignity.</i>) I
think I may lay it down as an axiom of the code that
one gentleman <i>may</i>—I say <i>may</i>—stand at all times for
any other gentleman. Now, the fact that the gentleman’s
second is absent looking for a surgeon must be
considered a valid reason for delay and consequently
<i>may</i>—I say advisedly <i>may</i>—allow slight alterations of
previous plans. My decision, then, is that your humble
servant might with absolute propriety—I say <i>might</i>
advisedly—stand temporarily for the absent second of
Mr. Tick. (<i>Bows to <span class="smcap">Tick</span>.</i>) I am at your service, sir.
I consent, to satisfy honor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spratt.</span> Very well, then let’s step thirty paces!
(<i>Business of measuring.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> (<i>Chuckles aside.</i>) That’s a safe distance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spratt.</span> Now for choice of position. Heads or tails?
(<i>Produces coin.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Short.</span> (<i>Solemnly.</i>) Heads.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spratt.</span> (<i>Tossing.</i>) Heads it is!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Short.</span> (<i>Tosses.</i>) Tails!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spratt.</span> (<i>Tossing.</i>) Heads it is! Your man gets the
advantage of the light. (<i>To <span class="smcap">Tick</span>.</i>) Let us examine
your weapons. Are they loaded?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> (<i>Producing knives from sack.</i>) They are! (<i>All
start at sight of knives.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Surprised.</i>) What in time are those implements?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> The weapons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Why, confound you, sir, I wont fight with
a butcher’s cleaver.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spratt.</span> Corncutters, I beg your pardon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> A vulgar agricultural implement. I won’t
fight with them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> I insist. I have the right to choose the
weapons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> But only gentlemen’s weapons. I’ll have you
understand, sir, that I do not choose to be hacked to
pieces with a sausage machine. Dr. Short, I appeal to
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Short.</span> (<i>With great deliberation.</i>) Your objection
is reasonable, and I may add, most weighty. This
uncouth weapon is unusual, and—and, <i>vulgar</i>, I use the
word vulgar advisedly in the sense of <i>common</i>, without
casting any reflection on this humble but useful agricultural
tool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> Gentlemen, <i>my</i> second pronounces the weapons
all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> A most remarkable second, sir! I’d like to
see him. Why doesn’t he appear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> I think I see him coming now. (<i>Hellos off R.</i>)
Hello! Hey! Hurry up there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spratt.</span> (<i>Repeats.</i>) A nigger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Short.</span> (<i>With disgust.</i>) A niggro. This is no

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> Isn’t he a man and brother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Furious.</i>) This is insufferable! This is a
gross insult to be atoned at once. (<i>Seizes one of corn
knives.</i>) I accept the weapons! Take your place. At the
word three, advance and defend yourself. I’ll make shoe
strings out of you, sir. (<i>Vehemently.</i>) I will, on my life
I will!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spratt.</span> One, two, three!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Come on. (<i>Makes pass at <span class="smcap">Tick</span> who easily eludes

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Twiggs</span> suddenly, R.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> Hello! What’s this? I expected a duel and
here’s a sprinting match. (<i>Laughs heartily. Looks at
<span class="smcap">Topp</span>.</i>) Why, Topp, what is that you hold in your hand?
An oyster opener? (<i><span class="smcap">Topp</span> and <span class="smcap">Twiggs</span> R. <span class="smcap">Short</span> and

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> Do you dare poke fun at me, sir. Don’t do
it again. You laugh again at your peril.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> Excuse me. I didn’t mean to talk shop,
my cachinatory muscles are subject to spasmodic movements.
But what are you doing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Throws it away in disgust.</i>) That man had the
impudence to bring a sausage knife on these hallowed
precincts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> Pardon me! A corncutter!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spratt.</span> No gentleman would propose a corncutter
as a decent weapon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> Quite right! We’ll have none of them.
They are perfectly absurd! Fit only for niggros. Nothing
like hair triggers. (<i>Steps toward C.</i>) Has any gentleman
a brace of pistols? I think I can arrange all to
the satisfaction of the company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spratt.</span> (<i>Comes down C.</i>) I brought a pair for alternatives.
(<i>Produces them from case.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> Ah, beauties!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> I object to hair triggers!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> On what grounds, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> They might go off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> A frivolous objection, sir! You owe Mr.
Topp satisfaction. Your position is absurd, and let
me say, sir, subjects you to suspicion; yes sir, to suspicion
of cowardice!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> (<i>Comes toward them, C., blusters.</i>) I’m no coward,
mind that! (<i>Aside.</i>) This is serious. (<i>Aside to
<span class="smcap">Twiggs</span>.</i>) I don’t want to fight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> (<i>In a friendly manner.</i>) Don’t want to fight?
What are your reasons?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> I might get hurt!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> That’s no reason!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> Come aside and I’ll tell you all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> Publicity is the only recourse at this stage
of the proceedings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> If you must then, I—I don’t wish to deprive
an honored house of its head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> None of your sentiment, sir!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> A very commendable sentiment, but invalid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Short.</span> Yes, insufficient.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> At this stage of the quarrel, without having
satisfied wounded honor, no gentleman would ever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
speak to either of you again. I advise one shot anyway.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> I insist on one shot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> I object to Mr. Topp’s second. He is here
through motives of revenge. I’ll leave it to Dr. Short
if motives of revenge are allowable in an affair of
honor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Short.</span> (<i>Emphatically.</i>) Never! (<i>To <span class="smcap">Spratt</span>,
sternly.</i>) Is this true, sir? (<i><span class="smcap">Spratt</span> silent.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gin.</span> It is. He’s mad at Mistah Tick ’cause he made
fun of his twins, Grover Cleveland Spratt and Benjamin
Harrison Spratt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> I recall some words now, when I come to
think of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> Resign, sir, at once! Do you resign?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spratt.</span> I do! (<i>Aside.</i>) They are onto my scheme.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gin.</span> (<i>To <span class="smcap">Spratt</span>, aside.</i>) Bettah git now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spratt.</span> I’ll get even with you, you black rascal.
(<i>Exit, while <span class="smcap">Gin.</span> goes through pantomime of kicking him
out.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> (<i>Muses.</i>) Hang it all, I’ll act as second
for both parties. How’s that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Short.</span> (<i>Gravely.</i>) Unusual, without precedent
but <i>honorable</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> (<i>Brusquely.</i>) Gentlemen, consider it settled!
Take your places! (<i>They move to places. <span class="smcap">Topp</span> R.,

<p><span class="smcap">Twiggs.</span> Ah, possibly. (<i>Reflects a moment.</i>) Stay, I
have an idea. (<i>Produces pistol from pocket.</i>) Dr. Short,
favor me with your weapon. (<i>Takes <span class="smcap">Short’s</span> pistol and

you to give the signal. The principals will kindly aim
at each other and, to show strict impartiality, I’ll shoot
at both. (<i>Levels a pistol at each of the principals.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Dodging.</i>) Hold on there!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Mr. Topp, there’s a slight mistake somewhere.
(<i>Everybody pauses for explanations, <span class="smcap">T.</span> crosses to
<span class="smcap">Topp</span>.</i>) I’ll try to clear it up. You advertised for
twins?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tick.</span> Twins! (<i>Makes face of surprise.</i>) Dogs!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> Generous man!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Annoyed.</i>) Madam, this is no place for a
disquisition on generosity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> So modest! Don’t deny it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> Your advertisement brought my daughters
to your house. You admired one of them, but I fear
you made advances to the wrong one by mistake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Pointing to <span class="smcap">Angie</span>.</i>) That is the young lady
I meant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T-K.</span> But unfortunately she objects. (<i>Confidentially.</i>)
I fear her affections are elsewhere. (<i><span class="smcap">Angie</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Topp.</span> (<i>Regarding <span class="smcap">Angie</span> and <span class="smcap">Tick</span>.</i>) Humph! Well,
I shouldn’t be surprised if they were. Here’s a pretty
state of affairs. I’ve made a fool of myself. Well,
“There’s no fool like an old fool.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T.</span> My dear Mr. Topp, a young man should
not be so pessimistic. Let me match your maxim with
another. “There’s just as good fish in the sea as ever
were caught.” (<i>Nudges <span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> aside.</i>) How’s that

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> Mr. Topp, let me introduce my daughter,
Mrs. Twiggs-Knott. (<i><span class="smcap">Topp</span> bows. <span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span>, confidentially.</i>)
She is the mother of lovely twins.</p>

<h3>ABOUT THE PLAY.</h3>

<p><i>Costumes</i> of the day. No special make-up is needed
and the only direction to be given is that each person
should dress in character.</p>

<p>The <i>dialect</i> of <span class="smcap">Ginger</span> is largely that of the conventional
stage darky, which is absurdly unlike the real
thing. It is used here for two reasons. First because
it is the conventional type that people in the north expect;
and second, because the real negro speech is very
hard to express in print, and would be very difficult
for an amateur to render with such slight study as is
usual. In fact the negro dialect of the south consists
largely in the peculiar <i>sonorous quality</i> of the negro voice
and in the use of <i>quaint expressions</i>. To pronounce “Massa”
“Massy” is to fail utterly in imitating the African.
It is broad and rich, <i>Mas’r</i> (<i>nearly</i>). Their grammar
is frequently very good, but the penchant of the African
to use high-sounding words often leads to very ludicrous
results. <span class="smcap">Topp’s Twins</span> will require careful <i>rehearsal</i>.
Owing to the peculiar nature of the humor and the droll
situations, anything like lagging will ruin the effect.
The man who plays <span class="smcap">Cadwalader Topp</span> must not forget
that he is always a gentleman, even in his anger, but he
is a <i>genial</i> gentleman and not an icicle. <span class="smcap">Tick’s</span> assurance
always has good nature in it, while <span class="smcap">Spratt’s</span> is
malicious. <span class="smcap">Mrs. Dubbledam</span> is slow, heavy and serious
in all she does.</p>

<p>The author has endeavored to follow the old style
and let the humor of the play flow continuously rather
than to depend on startling climaxes for effect.</p>

<p>The <i>duel</i> scene may be made very effective, but it
must not descend to “horse play.”</p>

<h3>CAST OF CHARACTERS.</h3>

<ul>
<li><span class="smcap">Patsy O’Wang</span>, alias Chin Sum, from Hong Kong.</li>
<li><span class="smcap">Dr. Henry Fluke</span>, who runs a sanitarium.</li>
<li><span class="smcap">Mike</span>, from the ould sod, an assistant.</li>
<li><span class="smcap">Mr. Boyler</span>, a patient with rheumatism.</li>
<li><span class="smcap">Mrs. Harriet Fluke.</span></li>

</ul>

<p class="center"><i>Time of Representation, thirty-five minutes.</i></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Synopsis and Hints to Players.</span></h3>

<p>The key to this capital farce is the remarkable transformation
of which Chin Sum is capable. Born of Irish
father and Chinese mother and brought up in barracks
at Hong Kong he has a remarkable dual nature. Whiskey,
the drink of his father, transforms him into
a true Irishman, while strong tea, the beverage of his
mother, has the power of restoring fully his Chinese
character. Dr. Fluke employs Chin as cook, on the
hearty recommendation of his old friend, Major
Barker. Unfortunately for the doctor, Chin gets at the
whiskey bottle through the carelessness of Mike, who,
in his way is no less a character than Chin Sum himself.
For the subsequent ludicrous incidents read the
text of the play.</p>

<p>The author believes that this farce will prove one of
the most popular. The extraordinary success of his
previous plays, notably the farces “Hans Von Smash.”
“Irish Linen Peddler,” and “Wide Enough for Two,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
renders this prediction a safe one. What the public
wants is <i>humor</i> and <i>action</i>. In the latter feature “Patsy
O’Wang” is unequaled. <i>Caution</i>, in fact, is necessary
here lest the play be overdone. Excessive boisterousness
and “horse play” should be carefully avoided.</p>

<p>This is a play that must be <i>well rehearsed</i>. It must
be kept in mind that while Mike and Norah are conventional
Irish with a thick brogue, Patsy (after his
transformation) speaks good English with little if any
brogue. In Hong Kong his associations were with officers
of the British army (as servant) and naturally he
acquired the language of gentlemen.</p>

<p>No instructions can be given here concerning the
Chinese part except that the <i>timbre</i> and <i>tones</i> of the
Chinese voice are very peculiar, and can be learned only
by listening to Chinamen. The Chinese dialect as written
here (and elsewhere in America) is at best but a
poor imitation, but good enough to be funny, which is
the only object in view.</p>

(can be fixed at home), and tunic to wear outside

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> (<i>Discovered as curtain arises.</i>) Well, Dr. Fluke,
<i>I</i> shant take the responsibility of having a Chinaman
in the house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> My dear, don’t be absurd! There’s no responsibility
in the case. Out in California, you know,
people are charmed with Chinese cooks. Why, your
sister couldn’t be induced to part with Weak Lung.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> Maria always was eccentric.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> But you know, darling, we have tried everything
but the Chinese—Irish, Swede, German, French,
African, Yankee—that’s so as we haven’t had any Hindoos
yet nor Cannibal Islanders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> Dear me! It makes me weary to think of it.
Why can’t we get along with Norah?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> (<i>Sarcastically.</i>) Or transform Mike into a
cook.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> Now you are absurd, Henry. I’ll wash my
hands of the whole affair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> My dear, that is just what I wanted you to say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> Indeed, then you needn’t have asked my
opinion at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> I am sure this Patsy O’Wang is a treasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> (<i>In astonishment.</i>) Patsy O’Wang! Patsy
doesn’t sound very Chinese.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> But he has a history.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> Oh indeed! That’s rather a doubtful accomplishment
for a cook.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> Quite the contrary! Harriet, I tell you that
I’ve found a treasure. Let me read you what Major
Barker says in his letter recommending Chin Sum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> Chin Sum! I thought you said his name
was—what barbarous name did you say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> (<i>Laughing.</i>) Patsy O’Wang! but that’s only
a nick-name. The Chinese of it is Chin Sum. Now
Chin is the son of a wild Irish officer in the tenth Artillery
stationed formerly at Hong Kong. His mother was
a pretty Chinese girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> (<i>Surprised.</i>) Well, did you ever!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> My dear, I admit that there is a slight flaw
in his pedigree. (<i>Looking at letter.</i>) But let me skip
all that. Major Barker speaks of him in the most extravagant
terms—(<i>reading</i>): “The best cook I ever
saw,” “the most obedient servant,” “the most affectionate
creature”; (<i>triumphantly</i>) isn’t that enough?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> I suppose so since apparently it is all settled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> There’s more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> Never mind, skip it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> Eh, what’s this? “Never under any circumstances
let him taste a drop of whiskey.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> Humph, then you’ll have to keep him and
Mike apart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> (<i>Reads to himself.</i>) Really that is surprising.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> What’s surprising?</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Norah</span>, L.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> Nothing, my dear (<i>reads</i>). “The remedy is”—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norah.</span> If you plaze, sor, the Chinee cook has come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> All right, Norah, show him his room and
then take him to the kitchen. My dear will you install
him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> No indeed! You may do that, Henry, till
he gets a start. Decidedly I feel nervous with a Chinaman
in the kitchen. Who knows but he may poison us
all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norah.</span> (<i>Re-enter with card.</i>) If you plaze, Mrs.
Fluke, Miss Simper’s at the dure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> Show her in, Norah, at once. (<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Norah</span>,
L.</i>) Now she will be trying to convert him.</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Miss Simper</span>, L.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> I’m delighted to see you, Miss Simper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss S.</span> Thank you! I just run in for a minute.
Good morning, Dr. Fluke.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> Good morning, Miss Simper. How charming
you look. That tonic benefited you greatly.
Shall I change the prescription?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss S.</span> (<i>Hastily.</i>) No, thank you, I have come
to-day in the interest of the missionary cause.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> Wont you step back into the parlor where
we can talk at leisure?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss S.</span> Oh no, I’m in a dreadful hurry. The African
Argonauts meet at eleven and I preside. We start
our first worker to Ashantee to-morrow. At 4 p. m. the
Mongolian Mediators have a meeting and at 8 p. m.
is the debate in which we shall answer the Cannibal
Calumniators.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> You are a very busy bee, Miss Simper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss S.</span> No, I’ve resigned from the Busy Bees; concentrating
you see. They say you have a new Chinese
cook, Mrs. Fluke.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> Not I. He’s the doctor’s importation.
Talk to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss S.</span> (<i>Enthusiastically.</i>) Oh doctor, tell me all
about him. My heart bleeds for the millions of Asia
who sit in outer darkness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> My dear Miss Simper, he is a gold nugget;
he will be a capital acquisition in your mission school,
so intelligent, so docile, so affectionate, so—so—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss S.</span> Just so. Oh, I’m perfectly delighted. Doctor,
does he—ah—has he doffed the Chinese garb yet and
donned the raiment of civilization?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> Blessed if I know. I’ll call him in and introduce
him at once. (<i>Rings.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss S.</span> Do so. I was just going to ask that very
favor. I’m sure he will agreeably surprise us all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> He will. (<i><span class="smcap">Norah</span> enters L.</i>) Bring Chin
Sum here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> I hope the wretch doesn’t smoke opium.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> Harriet, don’t expose your ignorance. That
is done in <i>joints</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> What kind of joints?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> Blessed if I know, bamboo joints possibly.
I hear the Chinese do most everything with bamboo
except to fight Japan. They did that in their minds.</p>

It’s what goes with thim.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norah.</span> Last time you know, Dr. Fluke said you’d
have to leave if you got drunk again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike.</span> It’s a bit o’ charity the doctor needs. Ivery
mon has some wakeness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norah.</span> And woman is weak too, so just carry out
that box of bottles for me, I’ll have to wash them here.
The doctor has some of his truck in the laboratory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike.</span> He’ll be blowin’ the whole place up yit

He’ll be here pretty soon for his electricity and that
Englishman will want his bawth. (<i><span class="smcap">Norah</span> washing

<p><span class="smcap">Mike.</span> Faith it’s enough to try the patience of ould
Job himself. Begob, Job never was docthor’s assistant.
I regret I iver intered the midical profession. Ivery
toime I look at ould Boyler he sez, Mike, ye’ve hurt me
rheumatiz again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norah.</span> Mike, you are too strong, you must be careful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike.</span> Faith I handle him just like a new born
baby, or like the egg with the chick unborn. But the
ould badger’s that tender I’m mortally afraid he’ll go
all to pieces in the bath tub.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norah.</span> Mr. Boyler complains to Doctor Fluke that
you are too rough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike.</span> Too rough, is it! Faith he’ll have to be
packed in cotton nixt. The Docthor was after tellin’
me to stretch Boyler’s limbs gintly loike an’ I tuk
hold av his arm with one hand and his shoulther with
the other like this and pulled like this, sort o’ bracin’
mysilf loike with one fut forinst the tub. I’m a thafe
if some jint or other didn’t snap like a pistol. I was
so scared that I dropped the ould bundle in the wather
hid over ears. I thought he was goin’ to exshplode
right there in me hands.</p>

sthrangled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norah.</span> Why, was he under the water so long as
that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike.</span> No, indade it wasn’t the wather. It was the
strong language. He is that way sometimes when his
emotions overcome him. When the ould sinner gets to
swearin’, he can’t stop till he sthrangles. After that
he’s very paceable for a shpell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norah.</span> But he’s awful good in spite of his rough
ways. He gives you many a quarter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike.</span> That he does and I couldn’t think more of
an only child if I had wan nor an only father ayther
for that matter. I’m prayin’ for him night an’ day.
If he survives these baths and the alectricity an’ the
drugs and the plasthers, it’ll be a great triumph of the
midical profession. There he comes now, I hear his

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Boyler</span>, L. angry.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> All humbug, sir!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> What’s that? Oh, it’s you, Mr. Boyler.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> At last I’ve found you out, Dr. Fluke!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> So it seems. Why bless me, if you aint cured.
Walking without a cane!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> Humbug! I said.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> But it’s a fact!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> You can’t hoodwink me, sir. You’re a charlatan!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> Don’t be unreasonable!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> Unreasonable! Oh, I <i>can’t</i> stand that. (<i><span class="smcap">Dr.</span> laughs.</i>)
Gad, sir, you are actually laughing at my misfortunes.
Do you call yourself a gentleman?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> Cut all that! What do you complain of?
You are cured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> Confound your cure. You first maltreat me, outrage
my feelings and then laugh at me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> When has all this happened?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> Every day for a month, Dr. Fluke. First you put
a Hercules in the shape of a wild Irishman to rub me
in the bath. He breaks every bone in my body by installments.
Then he pummels me by degrees into a jelly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> Well, what did you expect, Mr. Boyler? This
isn’t a kindergarten, and your rheumatism was a very
obstinate case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> Obstinate case! Let me say, sir, you are a butcher
and that Irishman is an executioner. To crown the indignity
you set a crazy Chinaman to give me the electrical
treatment. He runs a stream of liquid fire through
my leg.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> Which cured you completely!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> Will you let me speak, sir? When I protest, the
heathen doubles the quantity. Why gad, sir, it was something
terrific. I saw the constellation of Orion in
broad daylight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> Ah, it <i>is</i> a fine machine! A beauty!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> (<i>Laughs.</i>) There you are wrong, for I smashed it
to bits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> (<i>Starting.</i>) What’s that you say? My fine
machine ruined? I’ll have damages, Mr. Boyler.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> Damages! I shall sue you for $10,000 damages.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> Do it, sir, do it! It’ll make my fortune.
It will advertise the greatest cure of the age. Nothing
like a law suit for advertising purposes. Wont you
oblige me by breaking something else? Just upset
those shelves, wont you? Throw my instrument case
out of the window.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> I’ll not do it. I wont gratify you. A gentleman
can find other ways of avenging an insult. And
then there’s my wig, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> Where?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> Where? Do you doubt my word? (<i>Takes off hat
and exposes shiny bald head.</i>) Do you see that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> I see the head-piece but I don’t see any wig.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> (<i>Emphatically.</i>) No, sir, you don’t see any wig.
Your crazy Chinaman snatched it off my head and exposed
me to the indignity of going home barehead in
the public street.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> You shouldn’t go out barehead, you may
catch cold; I’ll not be responsible if you disobey orders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> And whose fault would it be?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> Yours, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> Why, hang your assurance, Dr. Fluke.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> I disapprove of your indiscretion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> (<i>Excitedly.</i>) Fluke, I don’t think I ever saw
quite such monumental effrontery as yours. That wig
cost me one hundred and fifty dollars, one of the very
best make by the celebrated Toupee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> Oh, we’ll not haggle about trifles. I’ll credit
it on the bill for the electric machine. That cost five
hundred dollars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> (<i>Gesticulating.</i>) Credit it on the bill! That’s cool,
why confound your insolence! I’ve a mind to cane you
on the spot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> But you can’t, you see. You have no cane.
You are cured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> (<i>With a roar.</i>) Oh, this man will put me crazy if
I stay here much longer. You’ll hear from me again,
Dr. Fluke. You are a quack. (<i>Bolts toward door as</i>—)</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Norah</span>, L., with tray, milk jug, sugar bowl, spoons
and plate of crackers. B. runs against her and sends things
flying as he exits.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norah.</span> Well, did yez iver see such a cyclone! (<i>Commences
picking up things around the stage.</i>)</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Mike</span>, L., carrying big tin tea-pot full of hot tea.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike.</span> Begorrah, it was lucky I was carryin’ the tay
pot or there’d been a Noah’s flood o’ tay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norah.</span> Must I get more crame, Docthor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike.</span> It’s aisy to pick that up with a spoon.</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> and <span class="smcap">Miss S.</span> appear timidly at door, L.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> Bother the cream. It’s the tea I want. Put
the things on the table. Now I’ll get him to come out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> Henry, do you think he’ll hurt you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss S.</span> The idea! Poor abused thing!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> Clear out, you women. Do you want to
frighten him? (<i>Exeunt <span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> and <span class="smcap">Miss S.</span></i>) Mike, go
in the operating room to be ready for emergencies.
(<i><span class="smcap">Mike</span> enters D. F. and peeps out from time to time, as do
the two ladies, L.</i>) Norah, you be ready to serve the tea.
I’ll drink some to make believe. Be cool, don’t lose
your head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norah.</span> (<i>Arranging tea things.</i>) Yis, sor, but I can’t
guarantee to kape me head if that ould cyclone blows
in again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> (<i>Knocks at office door.</i>) Patsy, come out
please. It’s nearly dinner time. (<i>Voice indistinctly
inside.</i>) What’s that? Yes, I’m all alone, that is,
Norah is here, too. (<i>Door opens cautiously. <span class="smcap">Patsy</span> looks
out, then comes out enveloped in doctor’s ulster and muffled to
the ears with doctor’s neckcloth. Wig frowzed till he looks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
like a fright. As he appears, heads at the other door disappear
suddenly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> (<i>Starting back.</i>) Why Patsy, are you cold?
I feel decidedly too warm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patsy.</span> I think I took a bit o’ cold in the cars, I’m
subject to sore throat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norah.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) Crazy as a June bug.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> Chin Sum, do you like tea?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patsy.</span> My name isn’t Chin Sum; just Patrick
O’Wang, if you please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> What is the <i>O</i> for, Patrick?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patsy.</span> The <i>O</i> shows that I’m a son of me father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> We have tea served. Sometimes we take a
light refreshment an hour or so before dinner. Patsy,
do you like tea?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patsy.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) Tea! (<i>With wink.</i>) I’m onto their
scheme. I’ll take a drop, weak if you please, one lump
of sugar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> (<i>Is at L. of table, seats himself facing front.</i>)
Norah, place a chair. Be seated, Patsy. You must be
tired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patsy.</span> Your honor I couldn’t sit in your presence.
(P. <i>is at R. of table.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> Very well, as you please. Norah, pour the
tea. Give me a small cup. For a cold it should be
drunk copiously. You had better take several cups,
Patsy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patsy.</span> Very well, sir, I like tea myself. (<i><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span>
chuckles to himself. <span class="smcap">Norah</span>, rear of table, hands doctor
a small cup then a large one to <span class="smcap">Patsy</span>. Latter has a
large hot-water bag under his ulster with rubber tube and
small funnel, all found in office. The collar of the ulster
must be very high and stand well forward. The funnel is
held by the left hand partially enveloped in a large silk handkerchief.
Under pretense of coddling his throat <span class="smcap">Patsy</span>
keeps his left hand up under his chin to keep the funnel concealed.
As he drinks he turns away to R. from the doctor,
back to audience, pours tea down funnel. As he hands cup<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
back to <span class="smcap">Norah</span> he thrusts his left hand beneath the ulster,
the top button of which is unbuttoned. Repeat with each cup.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> (<i>Sipping tea and nibbling a cracker.</i>) How do
you like the tea, Patsy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patsy.</span> (<i>Smacking his lips.</i>) It’s capital tea, doctor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> Norah, fill his cup. He wants several cups
to break his cold. Then I’ll put you to bed, Patsy,
and give you a good sweat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patsy.</span> All right, sir. (<i>Drinks as before.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) It’s working! Obedient already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norah.</span> Will yez have some more tay, docthor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> (<i>Impatiently.</i>) No, fill Patsy’s cup. Don’t
you see it’s empty. (<i><span class="smcap">Patsy</span> drinks.</i>) How do you feel
now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patsy.</span> Better already, doctor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> Have another! There’s nothing like tea.
Why, it will cure every ill that flesh is heir to. Norah,
fill his cup.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norah.</span> I’m pourin’ as fast as I can, sir. What a
dale o’ tea he do hold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patsy.</span> (<i>Handing back cup.</i>) Very nice tea, Norah.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norah.</span> I could do a dale betther with plenty o’
tay and more time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> Norah, why don’t you fill his cup instead of
talking. (<i>During this drinking the people at the door
enter and look on with increasing astonishment.</i>) How do
you feel now, Patsy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patsy.</span> Much better, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> Head clearer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patsy.</span> Well, it’s not as thick as putty an’ it’s not
as clear as a June mornin’.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> Try a few more cups, keep it up. Norah,
don’t you see his cup is empty. Pour him another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norah.</span> The mon’ll explode purty soon a drinkin’.
He’s swellin’ already. (<i>Patsy takes cup.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> Hold your tongue. The charm’s working
finely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norah.</span> Faith it’s time, the tay pot’s impty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> (<i>Jumping up surprised.</i>) Empty! Why girl
it holds a gallon!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norah.</span> An’ he’s drunk it all. The poor bye must
have the stomach of an osterich or a dodo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> Patsy, do you mean to say that you have
drank a gallon of tea?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patsy.</span> Faith, I think it’s nearer a barrel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> And how do you feel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patsy.</span> Like an irrigation canal! (<i>During these last
speeches <span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span>, <span class="smcap">Miss S.</span> and <span class="smcap">Mike</span> gather round back of

your experiments.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss S.</span> Poor dear man!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> Silence, ladies. This is a most extraordinary
case! (<i><span class="smcap">Patsy</span> stands perfectly still, facing them, left hand
to throat as before. Doctor takes him by the shoulder and
turns him round. <span class="smcap">P.</span> does not resist but makes a very wry
face.</i>) A remarkable case. Why, I’ve hypnotized him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike.</span> Begob, I think he’s paralyzed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> What makes the horrid creature act so?
He’s got a wild look. (<i><span class="smcap">Patsy</span> rolls his eyes. Women
retreat toward door.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norah.</span> I think he’s drownin’, I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> (<i>Severely.</i>) Patsy, why don’t you speak,
what ails you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patsy.</span> A bit o’ queerness here. (<i>Rubs stomach with
right hand.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> How’s your head?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patsy.</span> Me head’s all right. It’s me stomach.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> Do you still imagine you are an Irishman?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patsy.</span> I am, sir, Irish to the bone. (<i>Leans forward
as if pain in stomach. Rubs stomach with right hand and
squirms. All this time he has been holding his throat with
left hand and concealing the funnel.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> Says he’s Irish. He’s crazy, Henry. I
told you so. He’ll murder us all. (<i>Movement of all but
doctor toward doors as before.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Norah.</span> I give notice, Mrs. Fluke. I’ll not live in
the house with a crazy mon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike.</span> Nayther will I. I give up me job. It will
be hurtin’ the profession to mix with loonytics an’
Chinese.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> (<i>Irritated.</i>) Hold your tongue, Mike. This
is a most extraordinary case!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mike.</span> Indade it is! First he’s a haythen Chinee.
Then he takes a drop too much an’ goes wild an’ pulls
the clothes aff other people and says he’s an Irishman,
bad luck to him. Another dram’ll turn him into a Dago,
I belave. I quits to-day, doctor. (<i>During this time
<span class="smcap">Patsy’s</span> uneasiness is increasing; finally he begins to prance
round. Movement toward doors as before.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> Where is your pain, Patsy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patsy.</span> (<i>Groans.</i>) Me stomach feels all queer like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> Mike, get the stomach pump in the office.
Norah, a basin, quick! (<i><span class="smcap">Mike</span> runs for pump. <span class="smcap">Patsy</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> (<i>Is so astonished that he holds the bag by the
tube for a few seconds. Drops it in disgust.</i>) What does
this mean, you rascal?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patsy.</span> (<i>Determinedly.</i>) It means you can’t fill me
up with tea and turn me back into a Chinaman. They
did that trick in Hong Kong!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F.</span> But confound you man, I hired you for a
Chinaman. A bargain’s a bargain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>—<i>Office of <span class="smcap">Greathead &amp; Wright</span>, Publishers.
Discovered as curtain rises, <span class="smcap">Mr. Powers</span> a “reader” at
desk L., and <span class="smcap">Miss Bodman</span>, stenographer, working
writing machine R. <span class="smcap">P.</span> has large pile of MSS. before
him. He moves nervously and knocks off leaves that scatter
round floor. Rises impatiently.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Powers.</span> (<i>Talking to himself aloud.</i>) This is simply
killing. It would wear out a cast-iron man. (<i>Commences
picking up sheets.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> (<i>Glancing round.</i>) He’s in a bad humor this
morning. Some poor author will suffer for it. (<i>To <span class="smcap">P.</span></i>)
Found anything good, Mr. Powers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Powers.</span> Such books! Such inanity. Are all the
fools in the country turning authors?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> (<i>Laughing.</i>) Why, Mr. Powers, you forget
you are an author yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> No, Miss Bodman, I do not forget it. Here I
am, a man of genius, capable of winning the admiration
of two hemispheres, who has in fact surprised the civilized
world already, compelled to earn my bread by
delving among the rubbish of a literary muck-heap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> Why don’t you quit that and let your own
genius loose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Humph! A book like my “Countess Margo, or
A Romance of two Castles,” has no chance of winning
in this money-grubbing day. People don’t know
poetry, romance, pathos, and sympathy when they see
it. Genius is extinguished amid the meretricious glitterings
of fad literature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> Fie, Mr. Powers, I really believe you are
jealous of Mrs. Upperdyke Fadd, whose last novel
“Sweet Jingles Jangled” set everybody wild.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Miss Bodman, I hope I shall never be guilty of
jealousy of Mrs. Fadd. Why, my book, “A Romance of
Two Castles,” is a prose idyl. It is as different from
Mrs. Fadd’s “Sweet Jingles Jangled” as Confucius is
different from Brigham Young.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> Oh, what a comparison! I do admire your
command of language!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Ah, thank you. You are a woman of appreciation,
but the world—bah the world—(<i>Puts MSS. back on
table.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> What have you found there to cross you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> What have I found? The same old thing—rubbish
from the four quarters of the earth; drivel, nine
tenths of it absolute, unqualified idiocy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> Why, Mr. Powers, you are unusually sarcastic
to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Haven’t I cause? Here I, the author of “A Romance
of Two Castles,” am expected to read for Greathead
&amp; Wright, publishers, from two to five books per
day—and oh such stuff. I’m expected to decide the
fate of a book, subject to the final decision of Mr.
Greathead. And I get a scoring if I reject a book that
afterward succeeds with some other publisher.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> For instance, Gen. Radwell’s great book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Miss Bodman, that isn’t a pleasant subject. How
should I know that Gen. Radwell’s book would be the
greatest hit for a half century? Mr. Greathead stormed,
and I believe if it hadn’t been for Mr. Wright I should
not to-day be delving in this mountain of verbiage
as confidential reader and literary adviser for the great
publishing house of Greathead &amp; Wright. (<i>Slams down
MSS. on table beside <span class="smcap">Miss B.’s</span> desk, R. Rings bell.</i>) I’ll
tell Figgs to return that, it is all rot!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> Why, Mr. Powers, <i>you</i> are positively using
slang!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> I beg pardon, Miss Bodman, but I just couldn’t
help it this time. <i>It is rot.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> Why, whose book is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> It’s another interminable manuscript from Arthur
Welby. That man is a menace to society. He ought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
to be incarcerated. He keeps several novels on the go
all the time. They have been rejected by every publisher
on the continent, I believe. <i>He</i> calls himself an
author.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> But pardon me. He has published <i>one</i>
book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Oh yes, a book’s a book although there’s nothing
in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> But there is something in that one. It made
me weep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Yes, and it made his publisher weep too. Had
to sell it for old paper at one cent a pound. (<i>Rings bell
again.</i>) Where on earth is that boy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> Well, I don’t care, I liked Welby’s book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Oh, some people will like anything. (<i><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span>
stares.</i>) I mean, some sloppy critic called Welby the
American Dumas and that ruined him. Instead of
making his books smooth and—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss. B.</span> And stupid!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> No, in good form, flowing and soothing, he
crams them full of stirring scenes in imitation of the
old school. If I had to bring out Dumas with his sensationalism,
and Dickens with his exaggerations—well
they wouldn’t be brought out, that’s certain. (<i>Jabs bell
viciously.</i>) Where is that boy? Asleep again I suppose.</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> office boy, R.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Here William, tell Figgs to return this manuscript
by express, author’s expense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W.</span> Yes, sir!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Welby’s postage bills will ruin him. William,
muss it a little, so he’ll think it has been read.
Be careful now. You got chewing gum between the
sheets of one book and the author wrote to Mr. Greathead
about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W.</span> Will a few thumb prints do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Goodness, no! <i>I</i> don’t thumb print my books.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W.</span> Mr. Snap does.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Snap! The magazine and the book departments
are managed differently. Turn up a corner here and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
there and displace a sheet occasionally so that when
wrapped they will crease. Tell Figgs about that. (<i>Boy
fumbling with MSS. knocks it off table and the sheets fly in
every direction. In attempting to catch MSS. he overturns
the dish of water used with letter press and it rolls on floor
wetting some of sheets.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss. B.</span> (<i>Springing aside.</i>) Good gracious, William!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Just like a boy! A boy’s an animal! You’ve
made a pretty mess of things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W.</span> I’m only mussin’ it, sir. (<i>They gather up MSS.,
<span class="smcap">Miss. B.</span> wiping water from skirts.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Some of it is wet, it must be carefully dried.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss. B.</span> I’m afraid it’ll blur badly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Well, he at least cannot complain that it has
never been opened. One author actually had the audacity
to write that his book had never been opened.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> Had it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> I believe not. That joke was on Snap. They
botch things in the magazine department. I am careful
to open everything. No need to read it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> How <i>do</i> you decide on the merits without
reading?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Easy enough. There is a sort of recognized
literary clique. If a book has the countersign it is
read; if it comes from an outsider it is returned at once
with thanks, etc. Greathead &amp; Wright, in fact all publishers,
seek people with a reputation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> Dear me, how does an outsider get in then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> He doesn’t get in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> But how can an author get a reputation till
he has published a book?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> That’s his affair. He can’t surely expect to publish
till he has the reputation.</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Susan Ann Brown</span>, R. Her manner is brusque in
this scene and she talks down all opposition.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Is this the office of Greathead &amp; Wright,
Publishers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> (<i>Bowing, comes down C.</i>) It is. What can I do
for you, madam?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Mr. Greathead in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Your name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Susan Ann Brown. Is Mr. Greathead in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Not at present, it’s a little early.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Wright in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> (<i>Astonished at her manner.</i>) He is out of the city,
madam. Can’t I do something for you? Your business?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> (<i>With air of contempt for his position.</i>) I don’t
think you can. I called on very important business!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> I am here to attend to business!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> I can’t talk to clerks! I want to see one of
the firm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> If it is an order for books, the counting room is
just across the hall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> (<i>With toss of head.</i>) It isn’t an order. I am
an author. Have a novel, “Winds that Sough in the
Night,” 1,100 pages.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Madam, it is my business to take charge of manuscripts.
I—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> (<i>Emphatically.</i>) No, you don’t. I’ve heard
of your ways. Nobody but the firm will read my book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> But that is impossible. Our plan—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Is to give manuscripts to some clerk to be
fumbled over. As if a ten dollar clerk was the arbiter
of literature; or may be you send it out to some society
woman whose husband has failed in business, as if that
had fitted her to decide anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> But madam, if you will allow me, we consider
our readers competent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> And <i>I</i> think (<i>talks fast and emphatically but
distinctly</i>) an author knows something about a book
too, after toiling at it for months. Humph, do you
suppose I’ve been living so long for nothing and writing
all my life, too? Your plan, indeed! My book
“Winds that Sough in the Night” deals with <i>Theosophy</i>.
You would give that to some man who thinks Theosophy
all a humbug. He’d laugh at it and I’d be out my
postage. If my book was an exposé of Theosophy, you
would give it to some man who believed in the thing
and he’d turn it down for spite. Author out again—say,
when’ll Greathead be in?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> I should say inside half an hour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Which had I better see, Mr. Greathead or
Mr. Wright?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> (<i>Resignedly.</i>) Either will do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Then I’ll see Greathead first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Have you a letter of introduction, madam?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Don’t need any. I introduce myself. If
Greathead doesn’t come around to my views I’ll see
Wright. If he is not convinced, I’ll get the two together
and tell ’em what they are missing if they reject
my novel. Why, it is equal to Uncle Tom’s Cabin and
it is longer than “Robert El Smere.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> (<i>Getting impatient.</i>) Miss Brown, excuse me, I am
very busy, will you leave a card?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> No, I’ll be back in half an hour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> But what shall I say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Nothing. I’ll do the talking. I was a book
agent for five years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> And I’ve been in New York before! Don’t
forget that. And I’ve sold Greathead’s books. I guess
I’m not afraid of him. (<i>Exit, R.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> (<i>Drawing long breath.</i>) Did you ever!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Regular cyclone! Electric motor, quick
action.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> What will Mr. Greathead say to her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Trust him. He was a life insurance agent before
he was a publisher.</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Mr. Greathead</span>, R.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> They are on your desk, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> (<i>Going toward private office, D. F.</i>) Mr. Powers,
if that man Welby calls, positively, I can not see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
him. I suspect he is after me. It is in very bad taste
the way he is hounding publishers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Very, sir. I understand that Mr. Scooper of
Scooper &amp; Puff came pretty near ejecting him from
their office yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> That would do for Scooper &amp; Puff but not
for Greathead &amp; Wright. We aim to treat all authors
with the utmost courtesy. It is business, you see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Exactly, I’ll attend to him. I have already
examined his book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> What, already? It was only left late last
evening you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> I did not read it <i>all</i>. Same old thing. Harrowing
scenes, sensational and low types of people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> There’s something in Welby. I confess his
books interest me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Yes, he persists in following the old style and
strives to make his books interesting instead of easy,
polished, soothing. In short, he wholly ignores good
form.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> I had hopes for him once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> I had none. He insists in crowding his books
with incidents. Admires Dumas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Just so, a hopeless case! (<i>Exit <span class="smcap">G.</span>, D. F.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Now, Miss Bodman, let me dictate the letters to
Welby and Ralph Hyde-Arlington. I’d send the printed
form: “We have carefully read your valuable MS.
and beg to say that our reader does not advise us to
undertake its publication, etc. Thanks for esteemed
favor,” etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> And all that, taffy rejection of a MS. does
not imply literary deficiency, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> I’d give that to all of them straight, but apparently
Mr. Greathead has promised these two pretenders
that their MSS. shall have special attention. I think
Welby’s got it, too. (<i>Laughs.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> Mr. Welby would like a line as to the <i>reason</i>
his MS. is found unavailable, in case it is returned.
Poor man! he seemed to have a presentiment of refusal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Yes, apparently that is the only sane point left<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
in Welby. He has presentiments. He knows he is
going to get it in the neck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> Really, Mr. Powers, your language is shocking
to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> I can’t help it. Just think! In the last three
days some score of rejected authors have been insisting
on reasons, and I can’t give reasons. Mr. Greathead
has forbidden it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> But don’t you think an author is entitled
to some consideration where his own hard labor is concerned?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Great Scott! If I tried to satisfy them all I’d be
in an insane asylum before a month. They manage
that better in the magazine department. Mr. Wright
is a man of business. He has given orders to stop all
authors in the vestibule, take their books away from
them and show them out.</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">William</span>, R., carrying enormous armful of MSS.

to look at anything that is rolled. But I am a drudge.
I <i>have</i> to do it. Greathead is too easy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> But our letters, Mr. Powers,—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> (<i>Groans.</i>) I’ll make them short. (<i>Dictates.</i>) “Mr.

to mount Despair—”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> Do I take all that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> No, of course not. I’m talking now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> There are precious few authors anywhere in

mine. Go on please, you have the address.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Miss Bodman, you will please not interrupt—“The
Governor’s Daughter.” We regret that it is not
exactly suited to our present needs. Thanking you for
the opportunity of reading your very original book we
are, Very respectfully, Greathead &amp; Wright. Now for
that irrepressible poet, Mr. Ralph Hyde-Arlington.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> I hope you are not going to reject him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> I should say rather. Why not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> Some of his poems are just lovely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Stuff! Nothing but jingle!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> Quite the contrary. His “Lines to a Dead
Canary” are full of pathos and sentiment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Well, I admit that Hyde-Arlington’s lines have a
certain go about them suited to these times when ideas
are superfluous in literature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> (<i>With sentiment.</i>) What is your ideal of him,
Mr. Powers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Hum, I have no time to form ideals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> His name is quite romantic, Ralph Hyde-Arlington.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Yes, it looks well on a title page.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> I think he must be tall and handsome, with
dreamy eyes and dark curling locks. His sentiment is
<i>so</i> tender. He must be an Apollo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Possibly. I hope we shan’t have to verify that.
He’s in the city now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> I hope he’ll call.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> (<i>Emphatically.</i>) I hope he will not. You know I
dread the sight of an author as I dread small pox. Now
for his letter.</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">William</span>, suddenly, R.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">William.</span> Mr. Welby’s here again. He’s kind o’
excited. (<i><span class="smcap">P.</span> jumps up. Thrusts <span class="smcap">W.’s</span> letter into boy’s hand.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Mail that immediately, William. (<i>To <span class="smcap">Miss B</span>.</i>)
Tell Welby we’ve written. Say anything. Get rid of
him. (<i>Exit hastily, L.</i>)</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Welby</span>, R.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">W.</span> I beg pardon, Miss, I just called to say that I’ll
be in town three or four days yet. My address is Fifth
Avenue Hotel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> Yes, sir, I’ll note that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W.</span> (<i>Hesitating.</i>) My book was to have immediate
attention. I suppose it is in hand to-day. (<i>Boy at door
grins, holds letter, <span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> nods to him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> I think that it is—that is—oh, I remember.
The house has written you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W.</span> (<i>Excitedly.</i>) Oh, so soon. Then they must want
an interview. In that case I am at their service. I’ll
wait now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> (<i>Perplexed.</i>) Oh, no—I meant (<i>winks at <span class="smcap">W.</span>
again</i>) that is you had better see the letter.</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Ralph</span>, R.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ralph.</span> Is this the office of Greathead &amp; Wright,
Publishers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> Yes, sir, the counting room is just across
the hall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ralph.</span> The counting room is not what I want. I
seek an interview with the firm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> That is impossible. Mr. Wright has gone
to Boston and Mr. Greathead has been very busy of
late with authors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ralph.</span> Then Greathead is my man, I am an author.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> (<i>Surprised.</i>) In that case I’ll leave your
card on his desk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ralph.</span> I have no card. Poets can’t afford cards.
Just say Ralph Hyde-Arlington.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> (<i>Starts, drops note book.</i>) Oh! You are Mr.
Ralph Hyde-Arlington!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ralph.</span> (<i>Bowing.</i>) I am, Miss, at your service,
Ralph Hyde-Arlington, author of “The Dead Canary
and Other Poems.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Welby.</span> (<i>Picking up note book.</i>) Allow me, miss!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> Goodness me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Welby.</span> Are you ill, Miss Bodman?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> No, thank you! Just a momentary dizziness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ralph.</span> How my appearance affects her! (<i>Looks
proud.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> It’s gone now. Allow me Mr. Arthur Welby,
novelist, to introduce Mr. Ralph Hyde-Arlington, poet.
(<i>They shake hands down C.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Welby.</span> Ah! this is a pleasure, Mr. Hyde-Arlington.
My wife likes the “Dead Canary” very much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ralph.</span> (<i>Bowing.</i>) Thank you! Thank you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Welby.</span> In fact it is her favorite poem. By the
way, of course you’ve read my novel, “The Man from
Mattoon.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ralph.</span> (<i>Confused.</i>) No, I haven’t. I am reserving
that pleasure. It is inexcusable of me to have put off so
long, for it is a work of genius. (<i><span class="smcap">W.</span> bows.</i>) But you
see I’m a poor man and poetry doesn’t pay. We’ve
quite a family too—nine children now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> (<i>Exclaiming suddenly.</i>) Oh, goodness—I beg
pardon, gentlemen. (<i>Goes up to her type-writing machine.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W.</span> Really, I fear she is ill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ralph.</span> (<i>Aside to <span class="smcap">W.</span></i>) It is our presence that affects
her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W.</span> (<i>Starting.</i>) No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ralph.</span> Sure!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W.</span> (<i>To <span class="smcap">Miss B.</span></i>) Do you feel better?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> I am all right now, thank you. (<i>Rings bell.</i>)
Gentlemen, I’ll have you shown to the reception room
where you can converse undisturbed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W.</span> (<i>To <span class="smcap">Ralph</span>.</i>) I’ll send you a copy of, “The
Man from Mattoon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss. B.</span> William, show these gentlemen into reception
room. And ask Mr. Robinson the bookkeeper, to
step here a moment. (<i>Exeunt, R.</i>) Well, I never! That
man the poet, Ralph Hyde-Arlington. He looks like
a junk dealer, and married and nine children! Horrors!
I thought Lollie June Tibbie must be a willowy school
girl, but she proves to be forty and weighs 180. Oh,
the surprises of literature! Arlington’s face would
stop a clock.</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Re-enter</span> <span class="smcap">William</span>, R.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">William.</span> Robinson says he just wont take any
more poets out to lunch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William.</span> He went out with four yesterday, an’ to-day
he’s nearly dead with dyspepsy, or whatever ye call
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> Let the firm pay his doctor bill. I’m not
here to get rid of people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William.</span> He’s been takin’ pepsicum all day an’ says
he just wont do it fur nobody. (<i>Exit <span class="smcap">W.</span>, R.</i>)</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> and P. from D. F.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> (<i>Anxiously.</i>) Have they gone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> No, they are in the reception room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> Powers, I’ll leave it to you. I simply can’t
see Mr. Welby again. This is the fifth time we have
turned him down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Miss Bodman has mailed him a letter, and—by the
way, where did you send that letter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> Why to the Fifth Avenue hotel of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Oh, reckless young woman! now you have done
it. He’ll get that letter and be back here in fifteen
minutes, wanting <i>reasons</i>. The letter should have gone
to Mount Despair, Illinois.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> You mean <i>Mount Hope</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Yes, of course. Why didn’t you send it to Mount
Hope?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> Because you gave me his card with Fifth
Avenue Hotel address.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> We’ll have the bookkeeper take him to
lunch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> Robinson refuses. Says he is already dying
of indigestion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> Then it devolves on you, Powers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Mr. Greathead, I have heart trouble. Send for
Snap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> (<i>Laughs.</i>) I’ll put both of them in on Snap.
That’ll be a good joke, eh Powers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Oh very funny, sir. Snap played me that trick
once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> By the way, Miss Bodman, you had better
take your lunch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss B.</span> Yes, sir. (<i>Exit <span class="smcap">B.</span> R.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> Powers, what do you think of Mr. Wilbur
B. Chapter-Chapter’s new novel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> What can you expect from Chicago?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> But Chicago has her 400 now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> They <i>think</i> they have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> That amounts to the same thing. They will
buy Mr. Chapter-Chapter’s book solely because he is
in the 400.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Then you will sell it chiefly on the binding?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> Certainly! The most successful books nowadays
owe part of their success to the binder, just as
the stage carpenter builds a play.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> I think you are right, they have plenty of money
in Chicago—and pork.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> Powers, you are prejudiced against the West.
We must cater to them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Very well, sir. Chapter-Chapter’s book is good
enough for a caterer. There’s nothing in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> That makes no difference. Ideas make
literature but paper will make books.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> And it lacks the smooth, gum drop style of
Mrs. Fadd’s “Sweet Jingles Jangled.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> (<i>Laughs.</i>) Gum-drops! Powers, you are
rather severe on Mrs. Fadd. We can’t expect to equal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
her great book more than once in a decade. The only
point to be considered is this: Is Chapter-Chapter’s
book in good form?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Oh, the best. Why, he led the ball given in
honor of Princess Eulalia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> That fact alone is a capital start. We’ll
state it in the preface.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> And he dedicated the Joss House erected by the
Century Club to the adoration of the “Heavenly
Twins.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> Enough! We will publish Chapter-Chapter’s
book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> We should have it endorsed by the Supreme
Council of the New York Pow Wow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> That is very <i>easy</i>. The secretary will write
us a “Letter.”</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">William</span>, R.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">William.</span> Mr. Greathead, Mrs. Upperdyke Fadd
has called.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> (<i>Pleased.</i>) Show her in, William. Powers,
do your best. She likes compliment and she’s the
greatest writer of the time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> You mean <i>seller</i>, Mr. Greathead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> Yes, yes, but do try to worship her a little,
business you know.</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Fadd</span>, R.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> (<i>Effusively.</i>) My dear Mrs. Fadd, this is
indeed a pleasure. (<i>Places chair, C.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> (<i>Bowing.</i>) Yes, unfortunately we see so little of
authors, those wonderful people who make the world
laugh or weep at their will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> (<i>Tapping <span class="smcap">P.’s</span> shoulder.</i>) Very neat! I couldn’t
have said it so well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> (<i>Dropping in chair.</i>) You are very kind
gentlemen. But I’m here on business. How are the
books selling?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> The success of your book is simply phenomenal.
The sales of “Sweet Jingles Jangled” marks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
an era in the book business. Presses running day and
night. The name of Mrs. Upperdyke Fadd is on every
tongue, club talk, society talk, street car talk—why I
overheard one newsboy ask another: “Tim wot the dickens
did that Mrs. Upperdyke Fadd do?” (<i>All laugh.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> Yes, they do talk about me. (<i>Laughs.</i>)
Penalty of fame! And I am bored to death with letters
from everywhere on earth about goodness knows what all,
but mostly wanting subscriptions to something or other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> The penalty of greatness, madam!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> The only thing that I shall really push,
however, is the new Infirmary for Superannuated Lap-dogs.
One must concentrate nowadays. They’ve made
me a director in that. Mrs. Wilton Schuyler Vanderzumboom
is president. It is an enterprise undertaken
exclusively by the most fashionable society. They are
breaking their necks in the scramble to get in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Who, the lap-dogs?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> Oh dear, no, the ladies. How absurd!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> That’s only a little joke of Powers’. (<i>Gives
<span class="smcap">P.</span> a warning look.</i>) It is a most commendable thing—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> Apparently the day is past when a jest has
any relation to a witticism.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> No, no, you will have your joke too, Mrs.
Fadd. I mean the hospital.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> <i>Infirmary</i>, Mr. Greathead! One is expected
to do something and there are so many causes worthy
of help. I hesitated between the Humane Society and
the Infirmary for Superannuated Lap-dogs. Then I
thought I’d better limit myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> By the way, Mrs. Fadd, I hope you won’t
let anything interfere with your contract with Greathead
&amp; Wright. Two novels per month, you know, is
the agreement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> Pshaw! I could make it four, I really
believe, I write so very easily.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> By the way, Mr. Powers, that reminds me
that we ought to have Mrs. Fadd interviewed again.
She hasn’t been interviewed for nearly a month. Suppose
we do it now and send slips to the papers at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Miss Bodman is not here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> Couldn’t you manage to take it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Possibly, yes. (<i>Gets writing pad and seats himself
at desk.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> The public is very much interested in celebrities
just now. Napoleon you know, and Pillby. The
politician held sway a long time but now the other
people are falling into line. When the public hears of
success, they want to know all about its possessor. The
public idolize success. Now the papers are publishing
portraits of dashing Board of Trade men, brilliant,
brainy pork-packers, solid real estate men, smooth oil
refiners, expansive gas operators.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> I have seen a write-up of a philanthropic operator
in fire sales, ten-cent counter goods, etc.; made his
million of course. This is a progressive age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> Now, Mrs. Fadd, be kind enough to answer:</p>

<p>Q. What kind of paper do you write on?</p>

<p>A. Cream laid, note size.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Jersey cream?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> Powers, you are getting so absent-minded.
This is an interview of a literary celebrity.</p>

<p>Q. What sort of chair do you sit in?</p>

<p>A. Cane bottomed.</p>

<p>Q. Straight back or curved?</p>

<p>A. Slightly curved.</p>

<p>Q. You write easily?</p>

<p>A. Oh very! Why, it’s just dead easy. Goodness
me! What did the old-fashioned author do with his
time, I’d like to know. We read that they wrote and
scratched out and groaned and sweat; why I can’t understand
it. I drop the sheets on floor with my left hand,
(<i><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> “Got that Powers? With her left hand.”</i>) like
clock work, a sheet every five minutes, twelve sheets
an hour. Six thousand words per day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> Just think of it. A most prolific pen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Yes, the female pen is often very prolific.</p>

<p>Q. Do you have moods, Mrs. Fadd?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> Why, as to grammar—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> I mean the other kind of moods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>A. <i>Moods!</i> no indeed, if I had moods the public
would discern them. I set myself a standard of uniformity
and compel myself to attain it. When I wrote
“Sweet Jingles Jangled” I set myself to please. Labored
efforts never please. I said there shouldn’t be an
idea in the book, and there isn’t. The mistake of the
old authors was in thinking the public wanted ideas.
It does not want to be bored with ideas. It wants
smooth, flowing, soothing—what shall I say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Stuff.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> No, there is a better word. (<i>Thinks.</i>) Dear
me—for the present we’ll say stuff, that may be read
any where at any time without the possibility of exciting
thought or provoking tiresome discussion. That’s
why the public likes Mrs. Fadd. It knows Mrs. Fadd
is both safe and entertaining.</p>

<p>Q. Mrs. Fadd do you revise much?</p>

<p>A. Oh, never! I consider revision the rock on which
many authors have foundered. The moment you begin to
revise you break in upon that flowing smoothness which
the public likes, and then your stuff doesn’t appear
fresh. If you revise, your work is sure to show it, and
that the public resents, says you are straining after effect.
Why, we read of one of the old authors who rode round
town for an entire day in a half demented condition, in
a cab, to the great alarm of the driver. At last throwing
open the door, he jumped wildly into the street, at
the risk of his neck, exclaiming: “I’ve got it! I’ve got
it!” The cabman greatly relieved thought he alluded
to the fare and replied! “All right, sir! Seven hours,
one dollar an hour.” (<i>All laugh.</i>) The author angrily
replied: “You fool, I’m talking about a word I wanted.
At last I’ve got it.” Now is it any wonder that authors
who drove round in cabs looking for words were always
in indigent circumstances?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> A dictionary would be cheaper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> Decidedly! Now as to your personal life,
Mrs. Fadd, the public insists on knowing those things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> I’m sure I don’t object to telling.</p>

<p>Q. Do you take cream in your coffee?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>A. At breakfast, not at dinner.</p>

<p>Q. Sugar?</p>

<p>A. Yes.</p>

<p>Q. How many lumps?</p>

<p>A. Two at breakfast, one at dinner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> Note that Powers; curious eccentricity in
the matter of sugar. Expand that a little.</p>

<p>Q. Whose soap do you use?</p>

<p>A. Quince’s.</p>

<p>Q. If you only took a cigarette occasionally it
would add piquancy you know; royalty does it, duchesses
and all the <i>bizarre</i> people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> Oh, I <i>do</i> smoke a little but you really must
not put that in, I—</p>

I have an urgent engagement (<i>looks at watch</i>). Past time
now! Here, Powers, attend to the lady. (<i>Rushes out L.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> (<i>To <span class="smcap">P.</span></i>) So you are next to him. If <i>you</i>
decide you must first hear every line, no skipping. I’ll
see to that myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> (<i>Sits at his desk and commences to fumble MSS., out
of humor.</i>) My dear madam, our plan—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> And my plan is to do nothing half way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> But, Miss Brown, I really never could listen well.
My ear I think—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> I’ve a strong voice. I guess my way’s best.
I’m a good reader. (<i>Pulls up chair beside him to his surprise,
sits, opens MS.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> (<i>Groans.</i>) But madam, this isn’t regular.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> I’ve heard all about your putting off authors.
Now I’m here and I’m going to be heard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Good Lord, madam—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Just keep cool now. If you once hear “Winds
that Sough in the Night” you’ll want it. (<i>Reads.</i>)
“One evening, some thirty years ago, a solitary horseman
was seen winding his way over the bare, snow-clad
hills as the red December sun was slowly sinking
in the western horizon. As he rode along he was immersed
in—”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> (<i>Frantically.</i>) The river, I hope.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> We should get on better if you did not
anticipate, Powers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Anticipate! (<i>Jumps and rings bell. Instantly
gong sounds outside. <span class="smcap">Susan</span> jumps up in alarm, drops leaf
of MS.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> What was that? (<i>Gong again very loud.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Fire, madam, the place is on fire! Escape for
your life</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Merciful heaven, and if my precious book
should be burned. Why, my book is a legacy for the
ages. (<i>Rushes wildly out R. hugging MS.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> (<i>Laughs.</i>) That’s our last resort in self-defense.
Now may be I can do some work. (<i>Goes to desk and
takes up MS.</i>)</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Re-enter</span> <span class="smcap">Welby</span>, R.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">W.</span> I got that letter, Mr. Powers. I hardly expected
that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> They never do expect it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W.</span> What are your reasons for rejecting my great
book, “The Governor’s Daughter?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Because we did not want it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">W.</span> Sir, you are insulting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Very well, abuse me if you choose. I’m only an
employé. I have to be polite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W.</span> But has an author no rights? Must he go on
forever like the Wandering Jew and never be told anything?
If I were your tailor you would tell me what
was the matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> It costs more to put a book to press than it does
a coat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W.</span> I could possibly fix up the book or write one
that would please you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> I’m very sorry, Mr. Welby, but I’m only part
of a vast machine and we can’t give reasons for everything
we do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W.</span> But Mr. Greathead practically promised me an
interview.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Then see him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W.</span> How can I see him when he’s never visible?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> I’ll call him. (<i>Raps, D. F.</i>)</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">G.</span></i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> (<i>Starts back, surprised.</i>) Ah, is it you, Mr.
Welby?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W.</span> Yes. May I ask something about my book?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> Why, really it’s against our rules but, Powers,
suppose you take Mr. Welby out to lunch and talk with
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W.</span> I much prefer to see you, sir. I agree not to
bore you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> (<i>Gets hat.</i>) Then suppose you do me the
honor of lunching with me at the Club.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W.</span> With pleasure. (<i>Exeunt, R.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> (<i>Dropping in chair.</i>) I shall have softening of
the brain, I know it, I feel it coming on.</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Ralph</span>, R.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ralph.</span> Mr. Greathead in yet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ralph.</span> I’ve been waiting in the reception room two
hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> I’m very sorry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ralph.</span> Where is he? I’ll follow him all over New
York.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> (<i>Wearily.</i>) Gone to lunch with Mr. Welby.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ralph.</span> Welby, ha! Welby is taking advantage of
me. Why didn’t I invite Mr. Greathead to lunch with
me. (<i>Runs fingers through hair, assumes dignified air
which is very comical.</i>) May be I’m not so well dressed
as Welby, but clothes have nothing to do with literature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> But they do with books.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ralph.</span> A fine distinction. Mrs. Fadd wears good
clothes. Mr. Powers, while we are all alone, suppose
I just read you a few poems from my new volume,
“The Pith Soldier, and Other Poems?” They far surpass
the “Dead Canary.” You’ll want them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Mr. Hyde-Arlington, we never do that. It’s
against the rules.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ralph.</span> I mean just in an informal way between
ourselves. You know the success attained by my “Dead
Canary.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Impossible, my dear sir. The building may take fire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ralph.</span> (<i>Starting.</i>) Fire! What’s that you said?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> I mean—go on sir. (R. <i>begins unwrapping package.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) I’ll try the fire alarm. (<i>Before he can
ring bell</i>)—</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span>, R. hastily, <span class="smcap">Susan</span>.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Young man, that was a false alarm. There
wasn’t any fire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ralph.</span> Fire! No, my poetry is not as hot as Mrs.
Wheelwright’s.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> (<i>Ignores <span class="smcap">R.</span></i>) I lost a page of my book. I
couldn’t lose the least bit of it for the world. It is
my heart’s blood, drop by drop—oh, there it is! (<i>Picks
page under chair.</i>) Oh, how I’ve worked on that book,
I’ve burned for hours the midnight oil with aching head
and ceaseless toil. There! I didn’t mean to make poetry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ralph.</span> (<i>Sarcastically.</i>) You haven’t made any.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> (<i>With withering glance.</i>) Who are you, I’d
like to know?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ralph.</span> I am Ralph Hyde-Arlington, poet, author
of “The Dead Canary, and Other Poems.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> And I am Susan Ann Brown, novelist, author
of “Winds that Sough in the Night.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ralph.</span> Excuse me, madam, but you have interrupted
us. I was about to read my poems to Mr. Powers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Excuse <i>me</i>. I was here first. (<i><span class="smcap">Powers</span> in glee
watches dispute, rubs hands, then quietly gets hat and steals
out L.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ralph.</span> But you went out madam. A publishing
house is like a barber shop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> (<i>Snorts.</i>) Barber shop!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ralph.</span> Yes, when you leave you lose your turn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Humph! I don’t know anything about barber
shops, and I guess from your appearance you haven’t
been in one lately either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ralph.</span> Madam, the natural gallantry which appertains
to my sex and calling forbids me to argue this
question further with a lady. (<i>Sees that <span class="smcap">P.</span> is gone, gives
knowing look.</i>) Satisfied of my own rights in the matter
I yield to you, I go. (<i>Bows, exit R.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> He’s not so bad after all. But what a difference
between poetry and its producers. All contrast
in this world! Now Mr. Powers—(<i>reads same paragraph
as before, looks up, discovers <span class="smcap">P.</span> is gone, screams</i>)—all gone!
That fire must be real, for there isn’t a soul in sight.
(<i>Gong again.</i>) Oh dear, if my novel should be burned
it would be an irreparable loss to the world. The very
thought makes me shudder. (<i>Runs out R. crying</i> “fire!
fire!”)</p>

approaching coarseness.</p>

<h3>THE NEW WOMAN.</h3>

<h4>ACT I.</h4>

<div class="scene">

<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>—<i>Club rooms handsomely furnished. Entrance R.
in 1; door to dressing room R. in 3; screen to guard last
door; chair of President and small desk, up C; table of
Secretary left hand of President near flat; sofa R. of
President’s chair, another L. of Secretary’s table; door
to committee room L. in 2; screen to guard this door also.
Chairs in rows at right angles to desk and President’s
position, not too many nor set too formally; as members
rise or seat themselves they may move chairs a little so as
to give air of informality. Pictures, flowers, etc., to taste.
Screens far enough from wall that persons behind them
may be seen by audience. (If played in private house any
other arrangement suitable to the room may be made by
slight changes.) A few young ladies besides those in cast
may appear on rising of curtain to give idea of a considerable
club. They may chatter and giggle to interrupt
proceedings.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss H.</span> (<i>As pres., rapping on desk as curtain rises.</i>)
Order, ladies! The club will come to order. (<i>All continue
talking except sec’y who takes place.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dollie.</span> (<i>To member.</i>) Oh, say, have you read the
“Woman who Dared”? She’s the ideal new woman.
It’s just too lovely!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Member.</span> What loads of money she had. Just think,
two hundred suits! And her pants were a dream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> (<i>To member.</i>) I took <i>so</i> much pains with it,
and then to have them say such things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dollie.</span> (<i>Hearing.</i>) Oh, what did they say?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pres.</span> (<i>Raps vigorously.</i>) Order please, ladies! It
is already past the hour for meeting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> (<i>Sentimentally.</i>) Oh, I do take such an interest
in this club. If this club fails, the new woman—(<i>Pres.
sharply.</i>) “Order.” (<i><span class="smcap">Birdie</span> drops in seat.</i>) Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pres.</span> (<i>Raps very hard.</i>) The club will come to
order! Secretary, read—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Member.</span> (<i>Who has not yet heard the calls to order.</i>)
Ashes of roses trimmed with—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pres.</span> The object of this club is to cultivate self-reliant
<i>new</i> women. Let us live up to our opportunities.
Secretary, call the roll.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> (<i>Calls, nobody answers.</i>) Miss Hykight, Miss
Lightfoot, Miss Robbins, Miss Giglette, Miss
Smythe, Miss Tompkins, Miss White, Miss Spooner,
Miss Suitor, (<i>hesitates</i>) Miss Doughflyer, Miss—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Doughflyer.</span> (<i>Jumps up hastily.</i>) Miss President,
I wish to correct the secretary. (<i>With dignity.</i>)
My name is <i>not</i> Doughflyer though it is spelled that
way. We are English, you know, of Norman extraction,
and pronounce our name Duffy. It comes from
the French Du Fay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> I beg your pardon, pleased to make the correction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pres.</span> (<i>To sec.</i>) By the way, Miss Lightfoot, you
appear to be a stranger to Miss Duffy. Allow me to
introduce you. Miss Duffy, Miss Lightfoot; Miss
Lightfoot, Miss Duffy. (<i>They bow.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> (<i>Continues.</i>) Miss Hapgood, Miss Littlejohn,
Miss Brownmuffin—(<i>hesitates</i>) Willie Jones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chorus.</span> Good gracious, is she a boy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> (<i>Rises, severely.</i>) There seems to be some mistake
about that name. One of the rules of this club is
that no man shall ever enter its sacred precincts or
even be mentioned except pro forma. I think it is an
insult to the club even to mention a man’s name here
in that familiar way—Willie Jones—much less to put
his name on the roll.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pres.</span> I agree to that, Miss Robbins. It is in atrociously
bad taste if intended for a joke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> I found the name on a slip of members proposed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pres.</span> (<i>With dignity.</i>) Ladies, who proposed Willie
Jones? (<i>No answer. <span class="smcap">Dollie</span>, who has been busily talking
to a member suddenly realizes that some business is before
the club and asks</i>:)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dollie.</span> What is the question?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pres.</span> (<i>Sternly.</i>) The question is, who dared desecrate
our roll with the name of a man. Willie Jones,
who is he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dollie.</span> (<i>Jumps up.</i>) Goodness me, he’s not a he.
He’s a girl! (<i>All laugh.</i>) Such a ridiculous mistake!
It would so mortify poor Willie if she were here. She’s
such a dear, timid little thing; why, she hardly dares
breathe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> What a funny name for a girl, anyway.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dollie.</span> Poor thing, she can’t help it. Parents old
fashioned you know, and like men well enough to want
their names.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pres.</span> The name is very good since it is borne by a
woman. The new woman will not only do as she pleases,
but call herself what she pleases. She will not await
the pleasure of some man to bestow his precious name
on her. <i>I</i> never saw the man whose name <i>I</i> wanted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> (<i>Rises.</i>) Nor have <i>I</i>, the presumptuous creatures.
When they fit themselves to be the companions
of the nobler sex it will be time enough for them to ask
our friendship only, and for us to refuse if we choose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pres.</span> And we also assume the right to ask instead
of waiting patiently like slaves in a market. The new
woman will be no slave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chorus.</span> Never!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pres.</span> I believe the next business is to consider the
applications for new members to the “New Woman’s
Anti-homo Club.” (<i>To sec.</i>) What applications are
there to come up to-day? (<i>Members begin an epidemic of
whispering.</i>) Order please, ladies! (<i>Brief lull which
ends in a general buzz.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> (<i>Reads.</i>) The first name is Miss Ernestine
Arlington.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pres.</span> Who proposed Miss Arlington?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> Miss Brownmuffin, who is not present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pres.</span> Has anyone anything to say before the ballot
is taken?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dollie.</span> I don’t know that I ought to say anything.
(<i>General curiosity.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Oh yes, do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dollie.</span> But people might blame me for trying to
injure the girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pres.</span> Let people talk, the new woman does not care
a fig for what people say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dollie.</span> Miss Arlington is a very sweet girl, but—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> (<i>Rises.</i>) Miss President!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pres.</span> Miss Birdie Robbins.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> I rise to correct the language of Miss Giglette.
I object to the word sweet. It sounds silly.
The new woman will, I hope, not be a piece of confectionery,
inciting men to cannibalism.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dollie.</span> (<i>With slight emphasis.</i>) Well, I don’t care!
Ernestine <i>is</i> sweet but that’s not the worst, she’s engaged
to be married. (<i>Chorus of</i> “Oh’s.”)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Who is he? Oh, I didn’t mean that? Has
he money? Is he a foreigner?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pres.</span> A foreigner with money! Bah! A foreigner
is only better than the native tyrant in this, that he
makes no pretension to be suffering from that antiquated,
imaginary malady <i>love</i>. He boldly proclaims that
he gives his name and reserves his freedom. He is at
least honest. Engaged! Silly, weak creature, that’s
enough to know of her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> I should say!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pres.</span> The constitution of this club, as we all know,
forbids the marriage of its members. We believe that
we have a nobler work to accomplish in the world.
And I repeat, for the benefit of new members, that no
member of this club may receive any kind of attention
from any man nor pay attentions to any man, except by
consent and advice of this club.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> (<i>Rises.</i>) I think we ought to censure Miss
Brownmuffin for recommending such a creature who is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
weak enough to throw herself at a man in that way, for
I warrant she led him on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pres.</span> Are there any other names to be presented
to-day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> Yes, Mrs. Judge Stone!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Member.</span> (<i>Jumping up.</i>) But no <i>Missus</i> is eligible.
We will have no woman who is weak enough to marry
a man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> But Mrs. Judge Stone’s case is quite exceptional.
She is a brave woman. Filed a bill of divorce,
heard the case herself, and granted a decree with a
ripping alimony.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chorus.</span> Good, good! (<i>Applause.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> What was the cause?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> Her husband, the tyrant, objected to her smoking
during their reception to the Count Spaghetti, who
married Miss Bullion-Brown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chorus.</span> Oh! oh! the brute! served him right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pres.</span> I think we should admit this brilliant woman,
the champion of her sex, without the formality of a
ballot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> Yes, by all means, and extend her a vote of
thanks, besides, for her achievements in the cause of
progress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chorus.</span> Yes, yes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pres.</span> Mrs. Judge Stone is admitted by unanimous
consent, and the thanks is also a vote. (<i>To sec.</i>) What
is next?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> Some questions were to be presented for future
discussion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pres.</span> Read them!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> <span class="smcap">Whereas</span>: The New Woman’s Club and Anti-homo
Association points with pride to its record in the
matter of political and social reform, it further views
with alarm the gradual encroachments of the male sex
upon the dress of women. Witness the almost universal
adoption of bloomers by men of fashion, which is
rapidly being imitated by male maids of all work, and
even scullions and dish-washers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> Miss President, such a condition of affairs is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
ominous. It threatens the very foundations of society.
In my opinion men are secretly encouraged in such
practices by that class of women whom we designate as
marrying women. Our battle is not yet completely won.
A large number of our own sex oppose us, and cling to
the old system which made woman a slave. I therefore
move that a committee be named to call upon Her
Excellency, Governor Angelina Perkins, and Chief Justice
Daisy Flyer inviting them to a joint discussion of
this important question, in the rooms of this club.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dollie.</span> I second that motion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pres.</span> I see no harm in it and will name as the committee
ex-Judge Birdie Robbins, ex-Mayor Dollie
Giglette, of whom, by the way, we are all proud as
the youngest mayor ever elected in this city, and Miss
Brownmuffin. I think the question will be ably debated,
since it is well known that Governor Angelina Perkins
is inclined to a strict interpretation of the statutes,
while Chief Justice Daisy Flyer has liberal tendencies
and her rulings give men all the privileges which they
may fairly ask so long as society is constituted as at
present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dollie.</span> For my part I think the question not important.
Since women have almost universally adopted
pantaloons and derby hats I am willing that the men
wear bloomers and put feathers in their hats if they
choose. Men are naturally vain and the slaves of
fashion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> We set a bad example in our dress here!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pres.</span> Our dress here is only a survival, regalia in
fact, like that of the women’s Ancient Order of Matrimony.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dollie.</span> It is very absurd and should have been
abolished long ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> I have the following question to propose:
(<i>Reads.</i>) Shall men be compelled to remove their hats
in theatres?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> The law says plainly, they shall!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> The law, indeed! What’s the use to talk
about the law when the people have been fools enough<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
to elect a gang mayor and a man at that. He winks at
most outrageous infractions of the law! What are we
coming to?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dollie.</span> The remedy lies in the ballot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> (<i>Reads.</i>) Shall a woman give her seat in a
street car to a tired man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pres.</span> That question is absurd. If the man is young
and stylishly dressed he gets the seat and if he isn’t
he stands, that’s all. Is there any further business?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> None!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pres.</span> The club stands adjourned till the next regular
meeting. (<i>All rise and with a buzz disperse going R.
except pres. and sec.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span> Hykight, I am worried about the finances of
the club.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pink T.</span> Lightfoot, that is Doughflyer’s business!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span> Doughflyer is <i>so</i> reckless!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pink T.</span> How much do we owe?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span> Nearly five thousand dollars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pink T.</span> That is nothing for a wealthy club like
ours. Why, in the old times when men carried the
pocket-book and managed clubs they were always head
over heels in debt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span> (<i>Surprised.</i>) Why, Miss Pink T. Hykight!
Do you adduce the men’s clubs as examples for our
guidance?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pink T.</span> Certainly not. Their clubs are cheap nowadays
because we allow them so little pocket money.
And they are so weak in the matter of drinks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span> But we can’t pay bills even in 1950 without
money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pres.</span> I tire of hearing about money. Money has
never been the chief object in any condition of society.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span> We’ll not agree there. Our grandfathers and
fathers made a god of money, a swinish, brutal fetich.
But we must do something; our wine bill is enormous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pink T.</span> That comes of giving a banquet at the
Paragon Hotel and inviting a thirsty horde of men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span> But the bill must be paid, and the cigar man
is clamoring for his money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pink T.</span> Pay him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span> Pay him! Why, the bill is over three hundred
dollars. We do smoke so much and the members
are hanging the club up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pink T.</span> That is contrary to rules. Doughflyer is
responsible for that. She is too easy. By the way,
have you a cigar about you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span> No, I came down in the car with Judge Flyer
and she took the last one I had. I’ll ring for Mary to
bring in cigars.</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Mary</span>, R.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pink T.</span> Oh, here she is now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Miss Hykight, there is a man at the door
who wishes to see the president.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pink T.</span> A man! No man can come in here except
in extreme necessity or in a menial capacity. Tell him
to go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I have told him that. He insists, says he
must see the president and will not be put off longer.
(<i>Going L.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pink T.</span> Will not be put off! Such insolence! Call
a policeman. Goodness! I hear him coming in here!
He’s bound to speak to me. There’s no escape. I’m
subject to impeachment if this gets out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span> I shan’t take any chances. (<i>Runs out L.</i>, P.

<p><span class="smcap">Blake.</span> (<i>Bowing politely.</i>) Can I see the president
of the club?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pink T.</span> (<i>At L., with dignity.</i>) I am the president.
You are intruding, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blake.</span> (<i>Bowing very low.</i>) I beg your pardon but I
must see somebody.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pink T.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) <i>So</i> polite! Your business, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blake.</span> I am collector for the Universal Grab-all

<p><span class="smcap">Pink T.</span> I do not know. See Miss Daisy Doughflyer,
our financial secretary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blake.</span> Duffy! The name given me was <i>Doughflyer</i>!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pink T.</span> (<i>Laughs.</i>) How absurd! You got the name
wrong. She spells it Doughflyer and pronounces it
Duffy. She’s English, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blake.</span> Beg pardon! I didn’t know that. I’ve
looked all over town for that woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pink T.</span> She’s a lawyer. Doughflyer and Muldoon,
Cinderella building, corner of Matilda street and Marie
Louise avenue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blake.</span> Miss Hykight, I thank you for your courtesy.
Sorry I intruded. (<i>Bows politely.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pink T.</span> What a charming man! The gas officials

and no one is likely to come so soon after the business
meeting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blake.</span> You have a charming place here. But why
is it so very hard to see your officials, Miss Lightfoot?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span> Why, don’t you know? Our rules are very
strict. No man without a license is ever allowed to
enter here except on certain days of public receptions.
If you were seen here with me I should be subject to
impeachment and expulsion and you would be hopelessly
compromised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blake.</span> (<i>Starting.</i>) No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span> A fact! Can I rely on your discretion?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blake.</span> (<i>Bowing his best.</i>) You can. I would gladly
be the slave of such a charming creature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span> (<i>Pretending offense.</i>) No nonsense, please! The
new woman dislikes the word slave. On your honor, do
you promise silence?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blake.</span> (<i>Bowing.</i>) I do!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span> For your own sake, too!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blake.</span> I must preserve my reputation. I shall be

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span> Thank you! (<i>Exit R.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Well, if there aint trouble brewin’ here, my
name isn’t Mary Smilax. First the president making
eyes at him, and bribin’ me, and then the secretary.
And he’s just lovely, too. (<i>Hears noise.</i>) Oh, there’s

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Nonsense, Mack! I haven’t been out of my
office for five minutes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mack.</span> Don’t care, Smilax. I can’t be detained
this way. I’ll just leave your ice on the sidewalk hereafter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Do it if you dare, and we’ll just try the Susie
Miller Ice Company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mack.</span> The Susie Miller Co. be blowed! (<i>Coaxingly.</i>)
Now Smilax, you wouldn’t be that hard on
a feller an’ lose him a good customer like this club?
The company looks to its drivers to hold customers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> And it’s a poor dependence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mack.</span> Mary, don’t be hard on a feller.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Mr. Mack, your language is shockingly coarse
at times. <i>Feller</i> is slang.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mack.</span> Well, Mary—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> There you go again! Don’t call me Mary.
Call me Smilax, or Miss Smilax.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mack.</span> You used to be just Mary Smith.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Used to be isn’t now. Smith is too plain
and common for me. When I entered the employment
of this club I became a new woman, and I just took a
new name. I was tired of Smith. When I applied to
Justice Daisy Flyer to get a permit to change my name,
she said flowers were having a great run for names, and
I chose Smilax.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mack.</span> Mary, you are prettier to me than any flower.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Smiles.</i>) That is a very pretty compliment,
but you forget that it is only proper for <i>our</i> sex to pay
such compliments as that. The new woman—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mack.</span> Bother the new woman. Since you have become
a new woman, Mary, you drive me to distraction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Mr. Mack, you are really provoking. So weak
and sentimental. Do have a little regard for propriety,
and the modesty natural to your sex.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mack.</span> I never can please you now. The old woman
was hard enough to please, but the new one—heaven
help us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Mr. Mack, can’t I teach you that it is not
your place to compliment me, but my place to compliment
you? You are rather forward.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mack.</span> Oh, it has come to <i>that</i>, has it? (<i>Going, angry,

a little. (<i>Follows.</i>) He’s irresistible. John!</p>

<h4>ACT II.</h4>

<div class="scene">

<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>—<i>Club house as before. Time: Morning, a few
days later than Act I. Pres. Hykight discovered looking
at letter case.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Pink T.</span> Why, here <i>is</i> a letter. That’s strange; my
mail comes to my business office. (<i>Opens letter, reads.</i>)
Why, from that Mr. Blake of the Gas Company. Dear
me! I wrote him that he really must not come here
any more and he has the audacity to answer, saying
that he is obliged to come. The rules of the company
are inexorable, etc. Nonsense! It isn’t the rules of
the company that compel him. It is something else.
I guess I’m the attraction, in short. (<i>Sighs.</i>) I’m getting
tired of all this strife fighting the battles of reform.
The new woman is a pretty lonesome creature. But I
might have been brought up a marrying woman. And
if I had! Poor helpless creatures! (<i>Sighs.</i>) Well, sometimes
I think that I’d rather preside in a nice home than
in this club. Mr. Blake <i>is</i> handsome—such eyes and
such a mustache! and such manners! How kind of the
Gas Company to educate their men in etiquette. That<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
is because a woman is president of the company. Why,
I’ve read that in the old time the insolence of gas employés
almost equaled that of employés in the city hall
nowadays. But he is poor and I can not stoop! The
motto of the Hykights is “Upward,” and I, Pink T.
Hykight, a descendant of President Hykight, shall not
be the first to step out of the family rank. The Blakes
are of very good family, but Mr. Blake has only his
salary.</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Mary</span>, L.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh, are you here, Miss Hykight?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pink T.</span> Yes, I am early, called for my mail.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> How absurd it was for that carrier to get
stuck in the chute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pink T.</span> Yes, it might have been serious. Smilax,
I want the silver counted to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I’ll attend to it, Miss Hykight. (<i>Exit,
<span class="smcap">Mary</span>, L.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pink T.</span> (<i>Looking at letter.</i>) No, I think Chief of
Police, Brennan de Cork is more to my notion. The de
Cork’s have been illustrious for centuries. They were
kings of Ireland, and they say he has made his pile in
politics, too. I’ll propose to de Cork yet. I believe
he expects it, too. I’m sick of public life. Poor Blake!
I’ll just write him to call about the meter again and
find some way to let him know that his hopes are vain.
Poor thing! He is so infatuated with me. It’s dangerous
but I’ll risk it. (<i>Rings.</i>) I’ll write de Cork asking
him to theatre this very night. (<i>Writes hastily.</i>) No
stamp! I’ll mail it outside. (<i>Attempts to put note in
pocket; drops it on floor. Rings.</i>) Where are all the
servants?</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Mary</span>, L.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pink T.</span> Smilax, where is Belinda and Alfaretta
Pansy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I sent Belinda for cigars. Alfaretta is sick
to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pink T.</span> What hour do you open the club house?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> At eight o’clock, Miss Hykight, according
to regulation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pink T.</span> Is your help all here at that hour?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Promptly, Miss.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pink T.</span> When do members appear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Seldom before noon, and most of them after
four. You see the trouble of dressing in this old regalia
keeps them away. We ought to abolish such an ancient
rule and admit the modern dress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pink T.</span> That is a club matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Vexed.</i>) Oh, it’s not for me to say. I just
suggested. Miss President, the Swiss cheese for the bar
is hardly up to the last lot, I think. Will you come and
taste it? (<i>Exeunt L.</i>)</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Rosa Lightfoot</span>, R. 1.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span> (<i>Has not seen them, goes to letter case.</i>) A letter
for me! A strange hand! (<i>Reads.</i>) Why, it’s from
that Mr. Blake. Thanks me for my kindness! Dear
fellow. Hopes I may not think him bold. (<i>Laughs.</i>)
Such audacity! He is bold, but I like him for it. And
wants to meet me here. Oh goodness! That will never
do. (<i>Looks at note.</i>) Tuesday at nine. Hopes I’ll be
alone. Why, he may come any minute. How indiscreet
of him. He must love me desperately. (<i>Rings.</i>) Whatever
shall I do.</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Mary</span>, L.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span> Mary, I expect a person here on business—important
business. Is the committee room unoccupied
at this hour?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Yes, Miss, that is, unless Birdie Robbins
should come in. She goes round at all hours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span> (<i>Soliloquy.</i>) Why didn’t she go into literature?
She has no tact for politics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> No, Miss Lightfoot, she hasn’t a spoonful of
tact.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span> Ah, Mary, you needn’t notice everything. If
she or anyone else drops in just say the committee room
is in use, will you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Yes, Miss. (<i>Exit L.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span> How my heart flutters. I’ve read that in the
old times women’s hearts were always fluttering. That<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
is a weakness that comes from centuries of degenerate
training, but the new woman <i>will</i> master it yet. The
men manage better. Their great solid chests are as
impassive as statues. We can be nonchalant, too. I’ll
coolly light a cigar. (<i>Feels pocket.</i>) Goodness, I gave
the last one to Inspector Lillie Evergreen. (<i>Sound of
footsteps, R.</i>) Goodness, there he comes now. (<i>Listens.</i>)
He’s saying good day to some one at the door. Oh,
horrors! that’s Birdie Robbins’s voice. What shall I
do? (<i>Darts behind screen L.</i>)</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Birdie Robbins</span>, R.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> (<i>Cross.</i>) I’ll just look around and see that
everything is in decent order, and I dare say it isn’t at
all. The other directors leave all that to me. Governor
Perkins and Judge Flyer haven’t attended a directors’
meeting for three months. They ought to be ashamed
of themselves. (<i>Looks in letter box, takes letter out, reads.</i>)
Another appeal from the Pacific Coast Home Mission
Society. Urgent appeal for help. The Chinese are
sending missionaries to America by the score. Confucian
daily paper published in San Francisco. Dear
me, things are going to the bad headlong, and this club
doesn’t even protest. I wonder if those people have
repaired the faucets in the dressing room! (<i>Exit R.
U. E.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span> (<i>Comes from behind screen.</i>) This is a pretty
mess. I do hope he won’t come. If I try to stop him
at the door, it may lead to complications. (<i><span class="smcap">Birdie</span> heard
re-entering. <span class="smcap">Rosa</span> behind screen as before.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> Soap nearly all gone already. The servants
are robbing us, feeding their relatives at our expense,
and smoking our cigars by the score. We read that all
these things happened in the old times. Alfaretta sick
to-day! She’ll have to be sent to the tobacco cure and
the club will be obliged by law to pay the bills. Such
demoralization on every hand. When the men managed
things they stole everything in sight. I’ve just been
reading a curious old book of the last century called
“An Iron Crown.” There were big thieves then, according<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
to that author, who stole millions. Now women will
stoop to purloin a few cigars. (<i>Petulantly.</i>) I’m ashamed
of them. (<i>Sees note on floor.</i>) What is this? (<i>Picks it up.</i>)
Why this is directed to “Hon. Chief of Police, Brennan
de Cork.” It is unsealed too. Official business, doubtless,
I’ll see. (<i>Opens and reads.</i>) Mercy! Can this be
true? Impossible! I’ll put it back. No, it is a matter
too important to be concealed. (<i>Reads.</i>) “Hon. Brennan
de Cork: Miss Pink T. Hykight presents her compliments
to Mr. de Cork and desires the pleasure of his
company to the Elsie theatre to hear Paddiwinski next
Saturday evening. Find the usual gratuity for flowers
enclosed.” Such iniquity! I always suspected the sincerity
of that woman. Her crime shall be punished. As
vice-president, I shall call a directors’ meeting at once.
(<i>Exit R. 1.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span> (<i>Coming down.</i>) Here’s a pretty go! There’ll
be a scandal sure, for if there is a sincere member in
the club, it is Miss Robbins. Who would have thought
that Miss Hykight was so sly? Well, de Cork is a
great catch. Dear me, if I am discovered. Mr. Blake is
so indiscreet. I shall talk to him seriously. (<i>Steps
heard.</i>) Goodness, some one coming. (<i>Darts back
behind screen.</i>)</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Blake</span>, R. 1.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blake.</span> I do hope she’ll meet me. Not here! How
cruel! She thinks me too forward, but I can not conceal
my love. (<i><span class="smcap">Rosa</span> behind screen leans forward eagerly to
listen.</i>)</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Pink T.</span>, quietly, R. 1.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blake.</span> Yes, I’ve been too forward. She despises
me. (<i><span class="smcap">P. T.</span> advances on tip toe, also <span class="smcap">Rosa</span> comes further
down, pleased.</i>) Oh, for one word, one glance of those
beautiful eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pink T.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) Poor thing!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) How delightful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blake.</span> I have hoped in vain. (<i>Turns R.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pink T.</span> No, not so. Hope is—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span> (<i>Coming out, screams.</i>) Undone! Miss Hykight!
(<i>All stare in surprise for a few moments.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pink T.</span> Miss Lightfoot, explain your conduct, if
you please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span> Not to you, Miss Hykight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pink T.</span> Then to the club.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span> The club can have my resignation if that is
what you mean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pink T.</span> Your conduct has been scandalous. You
have lured this confiding young man here utterly
regardless of his reputation or the club’s.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span> Plague take the club! I love this man. Mr.
Blake, be mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pink T.</span> (<i>Loftily.</i>) Oh, indeed! If it comes to that
I think I am one too many. (<i>Sails out R. 1.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blake.</span> (<i>Modestly.</i>) I have been very indiscreet.
Forgive me, dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span> Darling, say no more, but you really must go
at once. (<i>Noise outside.</i>) Too late. Get behind the
screen there. (<i>He runs behind screen R., <span class="smcap">Rosa</span> L.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dollie.</span> (<i>With easy swagger.</i>) Here’s a go! That
silly little Bertie Howells thinks because I called on
him three or four times and took him to a concert once
that I’m going to marry him. Humph! he’s decidedly
fresh. But this is the poor boy’s first season in society,
and then (<i>with jaunty air</i>) I suppose I am to blame.
So far forgot himself as to write me a note. Well, I
must say, being an only child, his mamma’s millions
are very tempting. But then his papa is insupportable,
no pop-in-law for me just yet. (<i>Looks at letter box,
fingering letters.</i>) “Grantly,” “Gorman,” “Ginseng,”
“Gunther;” no Giglette. Well, the ninny hasn’t
sent any more notes, thank fortune. I’m pestered to
death with billet doux and designing papas. (<i>Going

as they should be. (<i>Puts flowers on the desk.</i>) The postman
is late to-day. Poor fellow! I wonder if he is
stuck in the tube again. I wouldn’t be shot through
that tube for anything. Just think of being chucked
into that pipe and fired a mile between breaths. The
man always looks as if he were out of breath. They
say all the carriers have to be hypnotized before they
go into the tube. I think it’s cruel. (<i>During this speech
she is looking at old letters in boxes.</i>) There are letters here
for a member that’s been dead five years. Why didn’t
that party give notice of her demise. (<i>Noise outside, L.</i>)
There’s Mack bringing the ice. Dear fellow! My
heart is all in a flutter. I’ll just wait to see if he comes
in here to speak to me. I know he will. He’s blue all
day if he doesn’t see me. Oh, if that terrible Birdie
Robbins should discover us. I aint a bit afraid of the

<p><span class="smcap">Mack.</span> (<i>Going L.</i>) Au revoir!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Just in time. Some one is coming.</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Hykight</span>, R., followed by members to attend
Directors’ meeting. Buzz of conversation. <span class="smcap">Miss Hykight</span>
takes chair, calls meeting to order. Members seated. Buzz
of conversation.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pres.</span> The meeting will come to order! (<i>Nobody<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
pays any attention.</i>) Order, ladies! (<i>Sharply.</i>) Order, if
you please. (<i>Sudden silence.</i>) A special meeting has
been called to transact very important business. The
call specifies an emergency and was made at the instance
of Vice-president Robbins. Secretary, are the
directors all present?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> (<i>Reads roll.</i>) Hykight, Robbins, Lightfoot,
Doughflyer, Willie Jones—not present. Is Miss Jones
in the city, does any one know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> (<i>Rises with solemn demeanor.</i>) Miss President,
I have an unpleasant duty to perform. (<i>All in attitude
of expectancy.</i>) I regret to say that Miss Willie Jones
is no longer worthy to be a member of this club.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chorus.</span> Oh! What has she done? Do tell us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> The story of her treachery is soon told. She
has eloped!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chorus.</span> Good gracious!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dollie.</span> And <i>so</i> timid!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> (<i>Severely.</i>) Timid, indeed! All put on! I
knew all the time that she’d do something. She’s as
sly as a weasel. I think no motion is necessary to strike
her name from the roll.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pres.</span> (<i>Gravely.</i>) No, that is not necessary. Secretary,
strike Miss Jones’ name from the roll. If there
is no objection I will appoint Miss Dollie Giglette
director in her place. Now, Miss Robbins, you may
state the object of the meeting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> Oh, I’m so overcome, I must have a moment’s
time. (<i>Uses smelling bottle.</i>) That horrid, sly,
deceitful Jones girl has completely upset my nerves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dollie.</span> Miss President, I think I can state the
object of this meeting, if Director Robbins will allow
me. It’s all about two men who get in here accidentally.
I think there’s a good deal of pother about
nothing. I advised Robbins to let the whole thing drop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> When such things are overlooked or winked
at, the days of the Anti-homo Club are numbered, its
purpose wholly defeated. Dissolution is at hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dollie.</span> Well, if a little thing like that is going to
kill it, I say—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> (<i>Severely.</i>) What does the constitution say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dollie.</span> If you insist, then let us take the matter
up. One was the ice man who has a yearly permit to
call once a day between the hours of 9 and 10 a. m.
The other was a plumber.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> I saw the wretch! He was no plumber.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dollie.</span> A plumber is what is known as an emergency
man and needs no permit, just as a male doctor
was once called in to treat a member, in an emergency.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> I demand an investigating committee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dollie.</span> Oh, I make no objection if you think it so
important as that. But emergencies will arise. The
ice man and the postman can not always be on time.
As we know, under the new system, the postman is shot
through the Instantaneous Pneumatic Delivery Company’s
tubes. Only a few days ago the poor fellow
stuck in the tube owing to his carelessness in dropping
a peach pit as he entered the chute. Reversing the
engine only wedged him tighter and he would have
smothered if one of the professors in charge had not
thought to fire fresh oxygen balls at him by means of
the new aluminum, vacuum, weather-report gun. Now
they can’t shoot a plumber through the tubes because—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> I insist this was no plumber. Plumbers
don’t wear eye-glasses. I found his on the floor.
(<i>Produces glass.</i> “Ohs” <i>by members.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pres.</span> Suppose we call Mary. (<i>Pulls bell.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> We might as well go to the bottom of the
matter. It’s sure to get into the papers now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> Yes, thanks to the indifference of the Public
Censor, Adelaide Witherspoon.</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Mary</span>, L.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pres.</span> Mary, have you seen any men in the club
rooms?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Only the licensed ones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> (<i>Severely.</i>) Smilax, do you ever examine
their licenses?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Why no! I know them all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> How careless! Now tell me plainly, have
you seen anything here that didn’t look right?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Confused.</i>) Why, I—that is—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dollie.</span> Robbins, had you not better leave all this
to the investigating committee?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> Let the president name it then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pres.</span> I name the president, the secretary and Miss
Dollie Giglette.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> I’ll have no whitewashing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pres.</span> (<i>Sternly.</i>) Is this a reflection on the chair
and the committee?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> I make no charges. I only demand my
rights. As the one making the motion, custom demands
that I be named on the committee. Add Doughflyer.
Doughflyer has the best interests of the club at heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I shall try to act in this grave matter as
would become my illustrious ancestors the Du Fays
who came over with the Normans.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dollie.</span> Oh, I’m a Norman, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pres.</span> We are making much of a trivial matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> You will find it not so trivial before we get
to the bottom. Smilax, tell me plainly, did you see
a plumber in the club rooms yesterday?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I? Goodness, no!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> Did you see a dude?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Throws up hands.</i>) Laws a me, no!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> Well, I did, and so did Giglette. With
him was another person, a fine-looking person I regret
to say, who evidently had no business here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> A dude! Shocking! A plumber is bad
enough but a dude—Let the investigation proceed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> (<i>Starting uneasily.</i>) Miss President, I decline
to serve on that committee. In fact, I have an important
communication to make and deem this an
opportune time. I hereby resign my office and my
membership in the club. (“Oh’s” <i>as before.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pres.</span> (<i>Solemnly.</i>) This investigation apparently is
about to assume a personal tone, which I deprecate and
can not countenance. I also resign rather than be a
party to such an inquisition. (<i>Rises, vacates chair, comes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
down C. Sensation</i> “oh’s,” “Did you ever,” <i>etc.</i>) And I
don’t mind saying further, since certain persons are so
inquisitive, that Chief of Police, Brennan de Cork has
consented to change his name soon to Hykight. (<i>Sensation
as before.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dollie.</span> Congratulations, old chap!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> (<i>Rises and comes out from desk.</i>) And Mr. Blake
of the gas company has at last consented to become
Mr. Blake-Lightfoot. I’ve saved enough for two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dollie.</span> Shake, old chap! (<i>Groans, others buzz.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> And, if you please, ladies, I give notice.
Next month I lead Mr. Mack to the altar. (<i>Excitement.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> And you too, Smilax! Since you were a
tiny waif, this club has been your mother and has
watched over you. We taught you to be a new woman,
and this is our reward.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh, please, Miss Robbins, I respect you
greatly, and I do love the club dearly (<i>sighs</i>), but I love
dear Mack more. I just couldn’t help it. (<i>Cries with
face in apron.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> There’s nothing to do but close the doors.
The club is dead. (<i>Wipes eyes.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dollie.</span> (<i>Crosses R. C., takes <span class="smcap">Birdie’s</span> hand.</i>) Cheer
up, Robbins, cheer up. You are not a marrying woman.
I value freedom too much to surrender it. And there’s
Doughflyer, she’ll stick by us. She has principles—and
a <i>name</i>. We’ll go on as before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> The mischief is done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dollie.</span> We’ll reorganize if necessary. (<i>She leads
<span class="smcap">Birdie</span> down C., dress stage.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Birdie.</span> (<i>Sadly.</i>) No, we never can survive this disaster.
The old woman will laugh at the new, and
ridicule kills. The club is dead. The finger of progress
goes back on the dial of time at least a century. Good-bye
dear, old club, the scene of my busiest, happiest,
hours. Good-bye forever.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Alice, I’m afraid Dick Plyer takes a little
too much wine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> I begin to think so myself. At that dinner
at the Brown’s he came pretty near making a show of
himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Go slow, Alice, don’t get too fond of him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> Leave that to me. I am decided on one thing
and that is I shall never marry a tippler. There may
be enough trouble in the family already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Sister, what do you mean by that, neither
of our brothers drinks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> No, thank heaven, but you don’t have to go
so far as that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> (<i>Jumps up, drops her work.</i>) Alice, what do
you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> I mean your husband, Mr. Bob Slightly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Alice, this is unkind of you. Robert never
was intoxicated in his life. He says so himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> Before long he may not be able to say that.
Sister, you don’t hear what people say, as I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> (<i>Distressed</i>) Alice, what do they say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> Well, they say that since Mr. Bob Slightly’s
old chum, Dick Plyer, has returned from the west, that
both are taking a great deal more liquor than is good
for them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> But Robert is so kind and so good natured
he can’t refuse, and his business requires it, you know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> I know it doesn’t. How does brother John
get along in the same business, without constant treating?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> But Robert never was drunk in his life.
He has often told me so. He never told me a lie yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> But he forgets that he has a liking for it, and
that his appetite will grow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Alice, you alarm me, this is dreadful. Oh,
anything but a drunkard! But why do you encourage
Dick Plyer, if he is so dangerous?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> Encourage him! I never encouraged him.
I wanted to be sure of his character, and now that I
know his weakness I shall decline his company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> But what can I do for poor Bob?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> Take the wine off your own table.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> I never thought of that. But then Robert
wishes it. It is necessary for his digestion he says.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> If put to the test which would he prefer?
You or the wine?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Oh me, of course. He is so fond of me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> That is what all wives say. Listen to me.
Dick Plyer has written me a note that he will call this
very evening. He’ll come up with Bob and you will
set out refreshments. The men will make a pretense
of eating, but they will drink a great deal more. For
some men the word <i>refreshments</i> means drink. They
don’t care a snap about the eating.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Oh goodness! I’ve noticed some men eat
enough for a family.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> Take my advice and observe them closely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> But what can I do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> I have a plan. To show your husband the
effects of intoxication in its true light just get drunk
yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> (<i>Surprised.</i>) I get drunk! Horrors! Alice,
are you crazy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> Not a bit of it. That’ll teach him a lesson
he won’t forget soon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> (<i>Decidedly.</i>) I shan’t do it, that would be
disgraceful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> (<i>Laughs.</i>) Just pretend, you goose. Did you
think I wanted you to march down the middle of Broad
street swinging your hat and singing “We wont go
home till morning?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> You are ridiculous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> Seriously, try it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> When?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> Now, this very evening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> It would be a great joke. But I can’t act
a part as you can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> Oh, it’s easy. Just stagger a little and look
silly and say idiotic things. You’ve seen men drunk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Do you think Robert would get angry?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> He might, but it’ll set him to thinking. Of
course he mustn’t find out the trick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> I’ll do it just for a lark, all to ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> It’ll be a capital joke. I’ll pretend not to
know what ails you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> How shall we proceed? Robert will be
home pretty soon to take his bicycle ride before dinner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> I’ll fill a wine bottle with cold tea and put
glasses on the table. (<i>Exit L. for things.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Alice is so full of mischief. I’m afraid I
can’t do it right. I’ll have to stagger and hiccup I
suppose and be quarrelsome. That is the way drunken
men always act in plays.</p>

her?—why didn’t you telephone for me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> (<i>In changed voice.</i>) Bob, you’re a trump!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> Oh, she’s out of her head!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> (<i>Reading.</i>) I guess not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> I say she is very sick. (<i>Feels his wife’s pulse.</i>)
She’s in a fever! How long has she been taken? (<i>Petulantly.</i>)
Why do you sit there so unconcernedly. Puss—Puss.
When was she taken?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> (<i>Reading.</i>) Oh, I found her that way when
I came in. She said she wasn’t sick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> But don’t you see she is sick? Can’t you do
something?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> (<i>Reading.</i>) Do something yourself. She’s
your wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) That horrid Mrs. Neverdun!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> Dear me! Is she sick?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> Yes, one of her fainting spells! Call some
one please, quick! (<i>Rubs <span class="smcap">Mrs. S.’s</span> hands.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> (<i>Down front, looks at bottles, sniffs suspiciously.</i>)
Well I never! Them bottles looks awful suspicious.
This is pretty goins-on for respectable people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> (<i>Busy working with <span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span></i>) Oh, Mrs. Neverdun,
please do something. The salts are on the side-board.
Call Mr. Slightly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> (<i>Down front.</i>) She’s drunk! Champagne,
too! That’s a matter for the church. I s’pose I’ll have
to testify.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> (<i>Coming down.</i>) Mrs. Neverdun, don’t let her
fall. Go to her. (<i><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> goes to <span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> I guess she aint very bad!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> You are, you know it, too!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> Highty tighty, that’s the best proof in the

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> How do you know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> Bob Slightly has had enough experience to

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Oh, Mrs. Neverdun, don’t speak that way.
You are mistaken, I can explain it all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> I aint askin’ no explanations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Please say nothing about this. I’ve been
foolish. Be my friend, will you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> Good land, haint I always been yer friend?
I haint an enemy in the world as I knows of. An haint
I been active in the sewin’ society an’ didn’t I give
them as nice refreshments as anybuddy? If I am
nobuddy but Ole Missus Neverdun, aint I as good as
the best of ’em. (<i>Gets voluble, talking faster and faster.</i>)
I aint no fool, I kin tell ye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Yes, but—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> I don’t care a tuppence fur their talk. My
tea an’ my coffee an’ my doughnuts aint beat nowhere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Yes, but I—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> I don’t care a rap. Mrs. Hartley wears dimons
and lace and she sets a mighty poor table, an’ I
aint afraid to tell her so. They all eat at my house till
I thought they’d bust. (<i><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> laughs.</i>) You kin laugh
Mrs. Slightly, but I won’t be put on. (<i>More and more
excited.</i>) An’ I’ll have my say when it comes to that.
Sallie Neverdun aint the kind to be put on an say
nothin’.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> But Mrs. Neverdun—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> I aint castin’ no reflections on <i>your</i> table,

sez I, “this layout beats Mrs. Hartley’s with her
dimons an’ her kerridges an’ she—”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> (<i>In despair.</i>) But, Mrs. Neverdun, haven’t I
always been your friend?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> I’ve nothin’ agin you, Mrs. Slightly.
Haven’t I just said that many’s a time? I said to Marier
Wilkins that your table beat Mrs. Hartley’s all holler,
with her dimons an’ two niggers to dish salat an’ turn
coffee. Why, her salat—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> (<i>Excitedly.</i>) But <i>Mrs.</i> Neverdun—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> There! it’s goin’ to her head agin. Lay

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Goodness! <i>do</i> let me say a word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> An’ haint ye been talkin’ all the time, I’d

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Please don’t say a word of what happened
here this afternoon. I can explain it all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> I aint askin’ no explanations, I tell ye.
Everybody must think Sallie Neverdun is an inimy o’
mankind goin’ round devowerin’. The whole town
knows I wouldn’t harm a worm o’ the arth. But s’posin’
it gits out an’ the church hauls me up as a witness, I
reckon they’d <i>make</i> me tell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> I’ve made a pretty mess of things. (<i>Calls.</i>)
Robert! Alice! Where can they be? (<i>Going L., meets
<span class="smcap">Alice</span> entering.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) Get rid of her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Hist, we must explain all. (<i>They turn C.
towards <span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span></i>) Where is Robert?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> I don’t know. The cook says he went tearing
down the street bare-headed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> No wonder he’s tearin’ round. It’s enough
to make any man tear round!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> (<i>To <span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span></i>) Go and look for Bob.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Oh goodness, what shall I do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> Don’t excite her, young woman! Lie down,
dearie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> (<i>Indignantly.</i>) I am perfectly well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> Indeed you are not, you are dreadfully
flushed! Are ye sick at the stummick? You must lie
down. (<i>Leads <span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span>, resisting, to sofa.</i>) Alice, arrange
the cushions. (<i>Just as they get her comfortably located.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> Are you better, darling?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> (<i>Faintly.</i>) I think so. I didn’t need Dr.
Gagg, dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr.</span> Nothing like precaution, madam. (<i>Feels her

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> (<i>Faintly.</i>) Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr.</span> Mr. Slightly, your wife’s nerves are unstrung!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> Well, I should think so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr.</span> She must have quiet. She’ll be all right to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) Knowed that much myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> (<i>Anxiously.</i>) What is the matter, doctor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr.</span> Old complaint with complications. (<i><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span>
throws up her hands unnoticed by <span class="smcap">Dr.</span></i>) Her nerves are
unstrung. Observe the abnormal action of the levator
labiæ superioris, the orbicularis oris and the levator
palpebrarum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> Land o’ rest! jist hear that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr.</span> I think there is a slight difficulty, too, in the
decussation of the medulla oblongata which has established
a sympathetic action with the solar plexus and
the pneumogastricus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> Say, Dr. Gagg, what does all that rigmarole
mean? hysterics?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr.</span> (<i>Glaring at her.</i>) The science of medicine,
madam, has made many advances since you were a child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> Ye don’t say! An’ I s’pose it’ll keep on a-dancin’

<p><span class="smcap">Dr.</span> (<i>Aside to <span class="smcap">Bob</span>.</i>) That woman is exciting your

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> I’m very sorry if I disturb her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> It is nothing at all. I am glad to see you,
Mr. Plyer. Alice, please show Dick a chair. (<i>Gives
<span class="smcap">Alice</span> knowing look.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> Take this seat, Mr. Plyer. (<i>Then goes and
whispers to <span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> I say, Dick, wont you go into the smoking
room? I’ll join you as soon as I can leave my wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Oh, certainly, I’m awful sorry! Can’t I be
of any use?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr.</span> Just one moment, Mr. Slightly. Take this prescription
to be filled at once! Make haste! Dose every
half hour, till patient finds relief. Miss Alice, wet a
cloth with vinegar and place it on her forehead. The
solar plexus is dangerously disturbed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> That’s an anatomy I never heerd tell of.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> Robert, I wish to speak with you, if Mr.
Plyer will step into the smoking room meanwhile.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Certainly! At your service. (<i>Bows politely,
exit D. F.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> (<i>Going with <span class="smcap">A.</span>, L.</i>) Excuse me a moment, Dr.</p>

come down C. so <span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> can not hear.</i>) You appear for
some reason to excite the patient. You had better go
at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> Oh, I kin take a hint.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr.</span> I mean for her sake, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> You needn’t palaver. What ails her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr.</span> (<i>Mysteriously.</i>) A very strange case, madam.
Very strange. It would baffle the skill of a young practitioner.
The eye of science madam—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> I ’low it takes the eye o’ science to see
through a grindstone when there aint no hole in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr.</span> (<i>Pleased.</i>) Exactly! I’ve had in my lifetime
just three such cases, all since la grippe came. I may
say, in fact, that I have discovered a new disease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> Doctor Gagg, you are a wise man. (<i>He
bows and looks puzzled.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr.</span> A compliment madam?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> Nonsense! Did you smell her breath?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr.</span> (<i>Surprised.</i>) I, no indeed! Why should I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> You’ve made a fool of yourself. She’s
drunk, that’s all!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr.</span> (<i>Excitedly.</i>) A fool! Drunk! Why madam,
this is scandalous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> Oh, keep cool. You’ll get well paid to say
nothin’. But didn’t I see the bottles on the table?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr.</span> But it is impossible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> Didn’t I see her stagger? If you don’t
b’lieve, look at the puddles of wine on the table.
Smell it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr.</span> (<i>Puts finger in liquid spilled, smells.</i>) True! Why,
this is an insult to my profession.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> Dr. Gagg, I wish a word in the smoking room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr.</span> (<i>Indignantly.</i>) I have a word, too, sir. You
have insulted my profession, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> But hold, I’ll explain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr.</span> I’ll not hold. I am the victim of a hoax. Your
wife is not sick at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> (<i>Nettled.</i>) Why didn’t you find that out at
first, then?</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Dick.</span></i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Yes, the eye of science, solar plexus, vinegar
and water, etc. (<i>laughs</i>). That’s great stuff. There’s
nothing like science.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr.</span> You are offensive, sir. I’ll have nothing to say
to <i>you</i>. (<i>To <span class="smcap">Bob</span>.</i>) Now, Mr. Slightly, your conduct
is most inexcusable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> But I’m trying to explain that it was all a
little joke between my wife and her sister. She was
only pretending.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr.</span> (<i>Pompously.</i>) And I am to be the victim of
other people’s jokes. You shall pay for this, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> Send in your bill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr.</span> Bill! Who cares for the paltry fee! My professional
feelings have been outraged. The profession
is not to be trifled with. Mr. Slightly, I’ve a mind to
sue you for damages.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> A fig for your dignity!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Oh, Robert!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Let him sue. Get me on the jury.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr.</span> (<i>Taking up pill bag angrily.</i>) I shall consult my
attorney at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> Save the trouble and the fee! Let lawyers
alone! Make your bill as large as you please. I prefer
to be plucked by one man rather than by two.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
Your professional dignity will at least insure <i>silence</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr.</span> (<i>Growling.</i>) Humph! <i>My</i> feelings are nothing!
(<i>To <span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span></i>) Madam, let me say to you that you are
a meddling old fool!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> Dr. Gagg, while ye’re at it say there’s a
pair of us. Bob Slightly may pull the wool over your
eyes, but he can’t fool me. Didn’t I see champagne
bottles, and didn’t I see her stagger, an’ didn’t—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Mrs. Neverdun, this is too much—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> Easy my dear! (<i>Restrains her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice.</span> (<i>To <span class="smcap">Dick</span>.</i>) Oh, Mr. Plyer, can’t you do something?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> (<i>Bowing politely.</i>) I’ll try. (<i>Steps forward to
<span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span>, good humoredly.</i>) Mrs. Neverdun, let me say a
word. I’ve always maintained that you can set a better
table any day than Mrs. Hartley.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> Well, I should say!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Now, when I stand up for people I want them
to stand up for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. N.</span> Them’s my principles!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Now, I can clear this matter up in just a minute.
Miss Alice, bring in those bottles and glasses.
(<i>Alice goes L.</i>) We’ll clear up this mystery in short order.
I guess I’ve seen enough of champagne to know
it when I see it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>—The rapid action in this play requires careful
rehearsal and strict attention to cues. In many
cases the least drag will spoil the effect. The boy who
does the caterwauling must be always ready the instant
he gets his cue from the prompter. He must be able
to produce the effect of <i>two</i> cats and should make the
audience hear distinctly.</p>

<h3>A FIRST CLASS HOTEL.</h3>

<div class="scene">

<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>—<i>Bed room, two cots, one up R. C. by flat, other by
wall, down L.; table near head of last, with books, pistol,
pipe, etc.; wash-stand against flat, L. C.; window in
flat, L.; (or a door anywhere at L. can be made to serve
for make-believe window by hanging a curtain.) As curtain
rises, <span class="smcap">Leggatt</span> in bed, apparently asleep, vest hanging
on chair at head of bed, pantaloons and coat on wall.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter Landlord</span> and <span class="smcap">Bulger</span>, R., <span class="smcap">Landlord</span> carrying
candle and <span class="smcap">Bulger’s</span> valise. Lights low.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Landlord.</span> This is the very best I can do, Mr. Bulger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> Hang it all, I believe I’ll go over to the
Eagle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Land.</span> Hist! (<i>Looks toward <span class="smcap">Leggatt</span>.</i>) You’ll wake
him. No use to go to the Eagle. All full there. It’s
County Fair, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> Hang the fair! Landlord, this is no way
to treat an old customer. This is a one-horse town anyway.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Land.</span> (<i>In low voice.</i>) Very sorry, Mr. Bulger, but I
didn’t make the town. It’s the best I can do. (<i>Looks
toward <span class="smcap">Leggatt</span>.</i>) Mr. Leggatt’s a very nice quiet gentleman.
(<i>Confidentially.</i>) Why, he’s a littery man!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> Confound literature! It aint in it with
trade.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Land.</span> Quite right, but it’s got to be humored same
as other things. He’s as quiet as a lamb if you don’t
wake him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> (<i>Suspiciously.</i>) Hum! And if he wakes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Land.</span> He’s kind o’ restless. He may walk the floor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> (<i>Growling.</i>) Indeed! Let him try it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Land.</span> (<i>Hand on <span class="smcap">B.’s</span> arm.</i>) Quiet now. You may
wake him. Good night, sir. (<i>Leaves candle on stand.
Exit R. softly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> (<i>Hangs coat on rack, goes to closet door, looks
in.</i>) What’s this? A two by three closet. (<i>Sits and
takes off boots.</i>) I’ll put my things in the closet, though I
don’t suppose this one-horse town can afford even a
burglar. I’ll strike this town from my list. Such a
snide hotel isn’t to be found this side the Mississippi
river. (<i>Goes in closet. <span class="smcap">Leg.</span> turns in bed and mutters in his
sleep. Caterwauling in alley. Boy outside up L. does this.</i>)</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Re-enter</span> <span class="smcap">Bulger</span>, in pajama or colored night robe. Examines
sheets.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> Damp, as usual! I’ll catch my death of
cold. I always get a cold in this town. The place is
so slow, that’s the only thing people can catch. (<i>Rings
bell by door R.</i>) I’ll have the sheets changed, if I have
to rouse every chambermaid in the house. (<i>Sits and
opens valise.</i>) I’ll take a liver pill while I think of it.
Always have to take a liver pill in this town. It’s so
slow that a man’s liver stops business. I am catching
cold already. If I sneeze I’ll wake him. (<i>Business of
suppressing sneeze.</i>) There’s a draft somewhere. (<i>Tip-toes
to window. <span class="smcap">Leggatt</span> turns and mutters in his sleep.
<span class="smcap">B.</span> stops.</i>) I’ll wake his literary nibbs, sure. (<i>Tries
window.</i>) Wide open and stuck fast; windows always
stick in this town. When they are up they stay up,
when they are down they stay down. And that old hay-seed
actually calls this a first-class hotel. He amuses
me. (<i>Sets candle on chair.</i>) Confound that bell. (<i>Pushes
it again several times.</i>) I guess I’ll smoke while I am
waiting. (<i>Goes to get pipe out of coat pocket.</i>) Where’s
that pipe? (<i>Pulls coat with impatience, rack comes down
with a clatter and coat swings round and knocks candle to
floor, putting it out. <span class="smcap">B.</span> darts to his bed and gets in.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> (<i>Rising to sitting posture.</i>) What’s that?
Who’s there? Heh? A burglar! I’ll shoot, you rascal!
(<i>Attempts to pull out drawer of his table to find pistol.
Drawer sticks and his books and everything go clatter to floor.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> (<i>Alarmed.</i>) Don’t shoot! Don’t! It’s
only me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> (<i>Excited</i>) Who’s me? (<i>Feeling for the
matches.</i>) Blow it, where’s that infernal candle? I’ll
have to get up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> Don’t get up! It’s all an accident.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> Who the deuce are you, anyway?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> (<i>Strikes match.</i>) I’m a guest of this beastly
hotel, if its victims may be called by so genteel a term
as guest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> (<i>Sitting up.</i>) A guest! I don’t like that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> (<i>Nettled.</i>) Neither do I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> You’ve disturbed me and now I’ll have a
night of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> I’m very sorry indeed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> So am I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> (<i>With surprise.</i>) Sir, I apologized.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> Confound your apology! I was sound
asleep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> You <i>are</i> a nice roommate. The landlord
was right when he said you were.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> I beg your pardon, stranger. I wasn’t
quite polite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> Don’t mention it. My name is Bulger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> And mine is Leggatt. (<i><span class="smcap">B.</span> crosses and they
shake.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> I’m very sorry I disturbed you. I had
just rung the bell and was waiting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> That bell hasn’t been connected with the
office for a year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> Oh, what a hotel!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> When I want anything I just throw a pop
bottle down to the right. (<i>Motions.</i>) It’ll break at the
office door and rouse the landlord.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> By George! It takes a literary man, after
all, for ideas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> You’ll find some empty pop bottles in the
closet. I keep them for that purpose—and the cats.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> (<i>Gets bottle.</i>) I’ll try it. Did you say to
the right?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> Yes, you can see the glass door if you
look out. Hit the pavement so the bottle will crash.
(<i><span class="smcap">Bulger</span> throws out of window, tremendous crash.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> What a crash for one bottle. I guess that
will fetch him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> Now you <i>have</i> done it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> Done what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> You’ve broken the glass of the hot bed
and the tomato plants will all freeze. You threw the
wrong way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> You said to the right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> I meant to <i>my</i> right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> (<i>Provoked.</i>) Well, I’ll be everlastingly—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> Hold on, Mr. Bulger, it isn’t worth swearing
about. It’s of no consequence. We shall have to
wait a month longer for tomatoes, that’s all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> I’m very sorry, Mr. Leggatt. I’ll turn in
now and risk the damp sheets. I hope you will sleep.
(<i>Gets in bed.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> But I won’t. I’m in for a night of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> What is the cause of your insomnia?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> My book!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> Keep away from the races, why don’t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> I don’t mean that kind of a book. It is
the great novel I am writing. It is killing me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> (<i>Blows out his candle.</i>) Ah! When are you
going to die?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> (<i>Testily.</i>) Die! I’m not going to die.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> (<i>Sleepily.</i>) You’ll make a long job of it in
this town, it’s so slow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> But I’m not here for that purpose, I say.
What is your line, by the way?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> (<i>Murmurs.</i>) Line—cheapest way—I’ll ship
your goods by Blue Line, same as before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> Blue Line! Are you drunk? (<i>Pause.</i>)
Hang it he’s asleep. I wish I could go to sleep like
that. I envy a drummer. (<i>Blows out candle, lies down
and covers up; caterwauling outside.</i>) That infernal cat
again! (<i>Turns over with nervous motion of sleepless man
and settles down. All still for say 15 seconds. <span class="smcap">B.</span> begins to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
snore loudly. <span class="smcap">Leggatt</span> sits up again, angrily.</i>) That
settles it! I shant sleep a wink to-night. I’ll read, I
guess. (<i>Lights candle.</i>) Where is that book? (<i>Dextrously
fishes book toward him by means of a cane which
stands at bedside, lays cane across table. Begins to read—any
book—gets interested, makes comments.</i>) This book is
simply drivel, such character drawing. There are no
great novelists anymore except myself and Tolstoi.
(<i>Reads paragraph.</i>) That fellow has a wretched style.
His cacophony is terrible. The true test of good writing
is to read it aloud. (<i>Reads aloud. <span class="smcap">B.</span> rolls over as
if about to wake.</i>) All stuff, the poorest kind of slush.
I can’t stand any more of that. (<i>Throws book on table and
accidentally knocks cane on floor with a rattle.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> (<i>Starts up and sits in bed.</i>) What was that?
Heh? (<i>No reply.</i>) Leggatt?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> Only my cane, sir. I’m very sorry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> So am I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> Ah, then we agree. Will you join me in
a pipe since you are awake?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> A pipe at midnight! Well, you are cool!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> No, I’m not. I am on the contrary
slightly feverish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> Your proposition is cool enough. Smoke
at this hour!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> I find it soothing. I cultivate repose
of mind. It isn’t what we are, you know, in this world
but how we like the situation. To like what we can’t
mend is the true philosophy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> Philosophy be blowed! This is a situation
that I don’t like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> I can’t say that I actually enjoy it but
since—(<i>Caterwauling outside.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> (<i>Gets up angrily.</i>) Oh those infernal cats.
I’d like to murder every cat in creation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> Kindly throw a pop bottle. Straight
ahead this time over the shed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> (<i>Snorting.</i>) Throw it yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> (<i>Coolly.</i>) It was only a suggestion to be
acted on or not at your discretion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> I’d as soon have a room over a boiler shop
as in this infernal little hotel. First-class—oh, what a
liar this landlord is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> My dear sir, your attitude toward Boniface
is hardly justifiable. Landlords indulge in hyperbole.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> Hyperbole! What is that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> It is the faculty of not letting a statement
lack strength.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> Well, I must say this landlord’s statements
are very robust.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> Neatly put, Bulger. I believe you cultivate
literature yourself. You should at any rate.
Literature—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> (<i>Walking floor.</i>) Literature be d—d.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> My dear sir, you wont sleep at all if you
go on at that rate. Since you decline to join me in a
pipe let me read a chapter of Squibbs’ last novel to
you; that’ll do the business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> (<i>Pausing in front of <span class="smcap">L.’s</span> cot.</i>) Read Squibbs
to me! At midnight, in a strange hotel! Preposterous!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> He is very soothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> (<i>Emphatically.</i>) I wont have it (<i>gets in bed</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> I’m very sorry. I’ll have to read all to
myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> (<i>Sitting up.</i>) Are you going to read?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> I am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> And keep that candle burning?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> Certainly! I don’t read in the dark. I
haven’t cat’s eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> Really, I say—do you know that I have a
call for the three o’clock train?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> Don’t worry about it, Bulger. I shall be
awake and I’ll call you promptly. Will 2:45 be about
right?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> (<i>Jumps up.</i>) That man is crazy. I’ll never
get a wink of sleep here. (<i>Seizes blanket.</i>) There’s a
sofa in the hall, I’ll try that. Next time I come to this
town I’ll stop at the roundhouse for a quiet place.
(<i>Runs out R. with candle and blanket.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> I am disappointed in him. I thought his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
nerves were sound. He’ll break down if he travels
long. He’ll catch cold in the hallway, I’m afraid.
(<i>Lays down book. Pause.</i>) My sleepy spell has come on.
I didn’t expect it till four o’clock. I believe I shall
not pass a white night, as the French say, after all.
(<i>Lies down and goes to sleep. Pause 15 seconds.</i>)</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Landlord</span>, tiptoe, R.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Land.</span> (<i>Looks at <span class="smcap">B.’s</span> bed, then at <span class="smcap">L.’s</span>.</i>) Bulger is a
strange man. Now, why did he leave his bed and take
that sofa in the hall? He’s the hardest customer to
please that comes this way. Doesn’t like cats, finicky
about drafts, always sends his steak back, objects to two
in a room. I s’pose two in a bed ’ud set ’im crazy. There
aint a steadier, nicer man in the house than Mr. Leggatt.
Where shall I put that Dutchman? The sofa was
the last thing. (<i>Scratches head.</i>) Why, here, of course.
I’ll just make up the bed! (<i>Hastily makes up bed.</i>) There,
he’ll not notice it has been slept in. (<i>Caterwauling outside.</i>)</p>

<p class="direction"><i>Exit R. and <span class="smcap">Re-enter</span> with <span class="smcap">Schnell</span>.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> (<i>Throws card away.</i>) Confound it man,
will you go to bed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Schnell.</span> Ya! Ya! (<i>Gets into bed.</i>) He vas not a

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> And look here, Mr. Wagonblock—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Schnell.</span> Nine, Schnell! of te firm—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> Well, Snell then; you’d better keep pretty
quiet. If this racket continues much longer I’ll miss
my four o’clock sleeping spell. Now I <i>wont</i> be disturbed.
(<i>Lies down.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Schnell.</span> Ya! Ya! (<i>Pause fifteen seconds, then loud<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>

was afraid of dot beaceful littery chap. He might
shoot if he hears dem cats. (<i>Rolls over.</i>) Vell, I ton’t
schleep, dot’s sure, alretty. (<i>Glances at <span class="smcap">L.’s</span> cot.</i>) Dot
man was tangerous. I yoost dries to ket a nap by der
office. (<i>Rises, softly stealing toward door, R., <span class="smcap">Leg.</span> rolls
over. <span class="smcap">Schnell</span>, alarmed, darts out.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> (<i>Sleepily yawns.</i>) More noise, somewhere,
and I was just going—(<i>settles down and drops to sleep,
short loud caterwauling, then all quiet.</i>)</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Bulger</span> steals in R. with candle.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> This night will be worse on me than a
week’s sickness. I’ll have to take another liver pill.
(<i>Takes pill.</i>) If I had a keg of powder under this old
hotel I’d blow it to Kingdom-come, landlord, cats and
all. But I mustn’t wake that author or he’ll want to
read Squibbs’ novel to me. He’s had a good sleep.
I’ve caught cold in that hall. It was like the Cave of
the Winds. (<i>Feels bed. Surprised.</i>) Why, that bed is
warm yet. That’s very strange! The room is as cold
as a barn. There’s no blanket here either. I left that
in the hall. If I close that window may be I can get
along. I’ll wake everybody in the house probably.
(<i>Goes softly to window, tugs at it, steals glance at <span class="smcap">Leggatt</span>,
gives a quick tug, down comes window on the run and breaks
a pane of glass.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> (<i>Starting up, sitting posture.</i>) What’s that?
Who’s there? (<i><span class="smcap">Bulger</span> crawls behind the curtains.</i>) Hey
there! Say! (<i>Pause.</i>) It’s that Dutchman again!
He’s worse than Bulger was. Fallen out of that rickety
old bed again, I suppose. If he’d only break his neck!
(<i>Scratching matches, lights candle.</i>) Why, he isn’t there.
Now, that’s odd! Both gone! A good riddance. I may
catch my four o’clock turn yet. (<i>Starts.</i>) My watch!
I’ll bet that Dutchman was a thief in disguise. (<i>Feels
in vest pocket.</i>) No, it is there all right. I have nothing
else to steal. I’m an author. He wouldn’t take
Squibbs’ novel. No, nobody would run away with
Squibbs. (<i>Looks at watch again.</i>) 2:45! It’s just time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
for Bulger’s train. (<i><span class="smcap">B.</span> behind curtain</i>, “Confound it.”)
What’s that? I surely heard a voice. Some one <i>is</i>
concealed somewhere. I’ll call the landlord. No bell.
I’ll catch cold if I get up to throw a pop bottle. I
guess I’ll just fire the pistol. (<i><span class="smcap">B.</span> in alarm dodges closer
to wall. Pistol shot.</i>) There! I guess that’ll fetch him.
I’ll give him a piece of my mind. When I took this
room I gave him the privilege of putting in a quiet
party occasionally. Quiet! This has been a delightfully
quiet night.</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Landlord</span>, R., excitedly followed by <span class="smcap">Schnell</span>.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Land.</span> Great heavens! Where was that shot?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Schnell.</span> Himmel! He sound like a cannon. I
joomp out o’ my schleep ten feet alretty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Land.</span> (<i>Excitedly.</i>) Where was it? The house will
be in an uproar. Leggatt, why don’t you speak?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> (<i>Coolly.</i>) I <i>will</i> speak. Landlord, it is
my deliberate opinion that you keep the worst hotel
that I ever saw.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Land.</span> That’s a slander, strictly first-class! But
the shot?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> In the absence of a bell the shot was
simply to call you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Land.</span> (<i>Angrily.</i>) Why, you don’t mean to say—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> That’s just what I mean to say. You
were to put only quiet people in here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Land.</span> Bulger is all right. Best man on the road.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> He has softening of the brain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Land.</span> Impossible! Bulger is one of the best salesmen
on the road.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> I’ve had enough of him. I think he’s
crazy. (<i><span class="smcap">B.</span> angry gesture from behind curtain.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Land.</span> Nonsense! His head is as level as—as mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> I wont dispute <i>that</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Land.</span> And you mean you fired a pistol and alarmed
the whole house just to tell me this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> I’m not done yet. Next thing you bring
in an idiotic Dutchman—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Schnell.</span> Vy, you rascal! dot is me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> (<i>With wave of hand.</i>) Allow me, Wagonblock.
I’m talking to the landlord.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Land.</span> Let up and go to sleep. You’ll be all right
in the morning. Where is Bulger? It’s train time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> Bulger! What do I know about Bulger?
Get out now and leave me alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Land.</span> But Bulger—(<i><span class="smcap">Leg.</span> lies down.</i>) Say, Leggatt!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Schnell.</span> I tink dot littery chap haf kilt Pulcher.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Land.</span> (<i>Starting.</i>) What? (<i>Seizes <span class="smcap">Leggatt</span> by arm
and jerks him to sitting posture.</i>) Produce Bulger. The
shot—Bulger. Have you murdered him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> (<i>Throwing him off.</i>) I’m ready to murder
somebody. (<i>Seizes cane.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Land.</span> (<i>Retreating.</i>) Where is Bulger?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> Here he is! (<i>Strides down angrily. <span class="smcap">Land.</span>
and <span class="smcap">Schnell</span> start back.</i>) And let me add to what that
literary man says. I thought he could use words better
in such a case than a plain drummer, but he isn’t in it.
Of all the noisy, windy, ill-kept, bad-smelling, disreputable
(<i>gets emphatic as he speaks</i>), disorderly, rag-tag-and-bob-tail
hotels in creation—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Schnell.</span> Mine Gott!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Land.</span> Hold on, sir. You’re going too far.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> I’ll go farther next trip. I’ll go to the
next town. (<i>Getting valise and things.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Land.</span> Your bill is ready.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulger.</span> (<i>Snorting.</i>) Bill! bill!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Land.</span> (<i>Decidedly.</i>) I said <i>bill</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leggatt.</span> Bulger, you’ll miss your train if you
stand there quarreling. Now clear out, all of you, or
I’ll miss my 4 o’clock sleep. I almost feel as if I
should miss it after this. (<i><span class="smcap">Landlord</span> takes <span class="smcap">B.’s</span> valise

Hi there, landlord, don’t leave that Dutchman here.

<h3>CHARACTERS.</h3>

<ul>
<li><span class="smcap">Madame Princeton</span>, Proprietor of Temple of Beauty.</li>
<li><span class="smcap">Mrs. Compton</span>, very stout, wants to be reduced.</li>
<li><span class="smcap">Miss Dickie Bird</span>, who wants to be bleached.</li>
<li><span class="smcap">Miss Terwilliger</span>, who is in search of a complexion.</li>
<li><span class="smcap">Miss McFadden</span>, a suspicious enquirer.</li>
<li><span class="smcap">Susan</span>, an assistant of Madame P.’s.</li>
</ul>

<p class="center"><i>Time of playing, twenty minutes.</i></p>

<h3>STAGE DIRECTIONS.</h3>

<p><i>R.</i> means right of the stage; <i>C.</i>, center; <i>R. C.</i>,
right center; <i>L.</i> left; <i>1 E.</i>, first entrance; <i>U. E.</i>, upper
entrance, etc.; <i>D. F.</i> door in flat or back of the stage.
The actor is supposed to be facing the audience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>—To present this piece properly, the ladies
must make up as directed. But young ladies as a rule
greatly dislike putting anything disfiguring on their
faces. Miss Terwilliger should use make-up paints, one
side of face fiery red, the other very brown, freckled.
But she may get along very well by bandaging one
side and splotching the other freely with court plaster,
reddened with carmine ink. It is best to select a lady
naturally stout, with a keen sense of humor, for Mrs.
Compton. Full instructions maybe found in a good
“make-up” book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> (<i>Discovered as curtain rises examining toilet
articles on shelves.</i>) The skin food is nearly out. Skin
food! Mutton fat and bergamot, cost, ten cents a jar.
China jar and gilt label twenty cents more, total thirty
cents, sells for five dollars. Well I guess there’s more
money in skin food than there is in stomach food or
brain food, for that matter. (<i>Takes up another bottle.</i>)
Anti-fat! Vinegar and water, three dollars a bottle.
Anti grandmother! (<i>Laughs.</i>) Why, I’m talking about
my relatives. What fools these women are. I’ll start
a Beauty Parlor I guess. (<i>Coquettishly.</i>) I am a sample
of Madame Princeton’s work myself. Humph! I never
did a blessed thing for my beauty. I wouldn’t put her
skin food on a mangy dog. That fat old Compton
thing goes waddling round taking anti-fat and jerking
the pulleys in the gymnasium. My, she makes me
laugh. She gets fatter every day.</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> briskly <span class="smcap">Madame P.</span>, R.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> Susan, have you opened up the gymnasium
to air it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Yes’m!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> Where is Mary?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> In the stock room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> Have we plenty of everything? There’s
going to be a run on Madame Princeton’s Toilet Articles.
The World’s Fair medal is a great card.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> I suppose we’ll get that medal before the
next Fair opens?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> The delay is so annoying. But we’ll do
as the others do—say we have it already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> The skin food is low.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> Did you telephone the commission man to
hurry up that mutton tallow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Yes, he sent it by mistake to Madame La
Duke’s Parlors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> Madame La Duke’s, indeed! I’ll sue her
for damages if she steals any more of my secrets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> I guess Madame La Duke knows mutton fat
from goose grease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> She is an ignorant imposter. Every idea
she has she stole from me. Tell Mary to set the girls
making a gross of skin food immediately. (<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Susan</span>,
L.</i>)</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Compton</span>, R., puffing.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> (<i>Running to meet her.</i>) Why, how charming
you look, Mrs. Compton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>Dropping in chair.</i>) I’m nearly starved to
death. I haven’t eaten a bite of meat for three days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> Abstinence and Madame Princeton’s Anti-fat
will do the business. Take a dose now, (<i>pours out
wine glass full</i>). That will revive you. It operates on
the fat glands and allays their abnormal activity. It
is excitement of the fat glands which causes excessive
flesh. Do you feel better? You’ve lost, I should say,
fifteen pounds the last week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> Madame Princeton, I just feel completely
gone. Why, when the girl brought in Mr. Compton’s
breakfast this morning, I felt like a wild animal. I
just wanted to grab his steak and tear it with my fingers
and teeth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> But you must not indulge your appetite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> I dare not or Mr. Compton would suspect.
Heaven forgive me the lies I’ve told that man. And I
a church member, too. Told him one day I had no
appetite, and the next a headache, and the next that I
had lunched hastily down town. Dear me, what can I
tell him next!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> Does he suspect you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> I’m afraid so. He said this morning if I
didn’t eat pretty soon he’d send for the doctor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> Keep it up three days more and then we’ll
surprise him. You will have lost at least thirty pounds
by that time. Your husband will be delighted at your
improved appearance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> I don’t know about that. He’s a queer
man. When I first met him I weighed only ninety
pounds. It didn’t seem to matter to him when I weighed
twice that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> But it does matter. He is deceiving you.
Men prefer willowly women.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> Maybe, but I’ve heard him say that Mrs.
Smith was as thin as the last run o’ June shad. Couldn’t
you fatten that woman? It would be a relief to her
neighbors if you could, and it would prove that you
can perform miracles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> Yes, get her to come in. I’ll give you a
commission. It’s very simple. If she’d only take my
Anti-lean. All she needs is to have the fat glands
stimulated. Anti-lean is the greatest discovery of the
age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> Would you mind telling me what it is; in
confidence, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> Oh, goodness, that is a professional secret.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> I’ll tell her about it, but, good land, what
ye’re doin’ to me would kill her. I couldn’t stand it
if I wasn’t as strong as an ox.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> You are doing bravely. What did you eat
for breakfast?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> Three oatmeal crackers and a cup of coffee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> You have broken the rules. I limited you
to two crackers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> It was Mr. Compton’s fault. He insisted
I should eat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> Any cream in the coffee?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> Only a spoonful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> You must obey me if you expect good
results. I’ll give you a double dose of Anti-fat. And
you shall lunch here to-day. One small white cracker,
one large pickle and a double portion of Anti-fat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> Mayn’t I have a chalk crayon to nibble at.
I’ll eat the wax candles next thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> Oh, you may have all the chalk you want.
Now go to the gymnasium. First the rowing apparatus,
then the dumb bells and lastly, the swinging rings.
That’ll fetch you round.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> If it doesn’t kill me. (<i>Exit D. F.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> How do you do, Miss Terwilliger? You
are very punctual. Some women have no notion what
an engagement means.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> (<i>Heavily veiled.</i>) Madame Princeton, my face
pains terribly. I am really alarmed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> (<i>Coldly.</i>) I told you there would be some
pain. Let me see your face. Removing freckles is
rather a painful operation, if done by the quick method.
(<i><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> removes veil, discloses bandage covering the whole
of one side of the face. <span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> removes bandage, shows
one side of face very red the other brown.</i>) It is working
beautifully.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> (<i>Goes to glass, shrieks.</i>) Oh, horrors! What
a fright! Oh, oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> Be cool, my dear.</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> from D. F.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> Goodness, what a start you gave me! (<i>Sees<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
<span class="smcap">Miss T.</span></i>) Why what on earth are you doing to that
girl? Poor child! One side of her face is red as a
beet and the other brown as a berry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> Really, Mrs. Compton, there is nothing
the matter. That is the way it always works, Miss
Terwilliger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> But my face is on fire, oh! oh! And I read
in the paper that a young lady died here undergoing
treatment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> That was all a lie! I’ll never let another
newspaper reporter interview me as long as I live. Come
this way for treatment. (<i>Going L.</i>) Madame Compton,
go back to your exercises. (<i>Exeunt <span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> and <span class="smcap">Miss
T.</span>, L.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> Well, I’m glad I haven’t freckles or warts
or whiskers. I never could stand it to be skinned alive,
I know. I’m so hungry I could eat a jar of that skin
food.</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Susan</span> L. Exit <span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span>, D. F.</i></p>

pretty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> You are Miss Dickie Bird?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span> I am. I have an appointment at this hour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> I operate on the hair. Take this seat. (<i><span class="smcap">Dickie</span>
seated facing L. so audience can have side view of hair and
face; lets down <span class="smcap">Dickie’s</span> hair, which must be dark and beautiful.</i>)
Oh, what beautiful hair! If I had that hair I
wouldn’t dye it for the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span> But blondes are so fashionable! They are
all the rage, you know. (<i><span class="smcap">Susan</span> tucking the barber’s
apron closely round <span class="smcap">Dickie</span>.</i>) Does it cause any inconvenience?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Not the least! You can not appear anywhere
for several days. (<i>Scream from <span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> heard
off L.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span> (<i>Bounding from chair.</i>) Goodness! What is
that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Oh, nothing. They are skinning a girl in
there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span> Mercy sakes! Skinning a girl! That is
horrible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> (<i>Laughs.</i>) You misunderstand. It is the
complexion treatment. It takes off the old skin, and I
think they took it off that girl pretty deep. It burns
like fire at first. (<i>Another scream.</i>)</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> runs out D. F.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> My nerves just wont stand that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span> I’m very glad I don’t have to be skinned.
Ugh! it makes me shudder. (<i>Gets in chair.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> And what are you going to have done?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span> I’m going to be bleached!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> What color?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span> Why, blonde, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> Well, if I had that head of hair I wouldn’t
bleach it for the world. What lovely hair, and Mr.
Compton does so admire hair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span> (<i>Coquettishly.</i>) They all do. (<i>Susan getting
bottles and brushes.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Are you ready, Miss Bird?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span> Quite ready.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>Going D. F.</i>) Bird! That must be Dickie
Bird. Giddy thing! She’s the worst flirt in town. Oh
dear, I could eat a raw frog! (<i>Exit D. F. Noise of
pulleys going furiously.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span> What is that fat old thing doing here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Improving her shape. She’s on Anti-fat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span> (<i>Sarcastically.</i>) You couldn’t reduce her
waist with one of those what do you call ’em machines.
She’s had her day. Why doesn’t she stay at home with
her old man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> Neither age nor condition is beyond the aid
of Madame Princeton. That woman can work miracles.
(<i><span class="smcap">Dickie</span> is now swathed in apron and towels till she looks like
a mummy.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span> Why are you so very particular about wrapping
me up, Susan?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> The stuff is very powerful. I musn’t let
a single drop get on your skin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span> Oh dear, I am nervous. (<i>Tries to move.</i>)
Mercy, I can’t move hand or foot. (<i>Screams.</i>)</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span>, hastily, <span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span>, L.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> What is the matter, Miss Bird?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span> I am afraid!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> My dear, there isn’t the slightest pain or
danger. Go on, Susan. (<i>Aside to <span class="smcap">Susan</span>.</i>) You’ve been
talking again. Why can’t you keep your customers
quiet like mine. (<i>Scream from <span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> who runs in,
one side of face in great red blotches.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Madame Princeton, you will kill me! Oh,
how my face smarts!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> It can’t hurt much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> It’s on fire! Oh, oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> Only a temporary twinge, Miss Terwilliger.
(<i>Gets between <span class="smcap">Dickie’s</span> chair and <span class="smcap">Miss T.</span>, turns latter
away, nods to <span class="smcap">Susan</span> who busies herself with <span class="smcap">Dickie</span>.</i>) To-day
I will apply my great discovery, Pastilla di Pasta
and to-morrow you will have the complexion of a baby.

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> Madame Princeton, haven’t I exercised
enough to-day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> (<i>Severely.</i>) Not half enough!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> (<i>Puffing.</i>) Well, I shall die, that’s what
I’ll do!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> (<i>Impatiently.</i>) I wouldn’t if I were you,
Mrs. Compton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> Madame Princeton, you are positively cruel!
I believe you actually enjoy our sufferings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> That’s right, excite yourself! Your heart
is strong and excitement reduces flesh. It stimulates
the lean glands, just as repose invigorates the fat
glands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> But s’pose I die right here in your place.
Think of the consequences. One woman did die.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> No, she didn’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span> Goodness, that woman makes me nervous.
Talks of dying in the place. I can’t stand this any
longer. (<i>Tries to rise.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan.</span> (<i>Restraining her.</i>) Be careful, you’ll make
me spill it and then—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> Susan, hold your tongue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span> I am afraid. (<i>Manages to stand up, swathed
like a mummy, <span class="smcap">Mad.</span> and <span class="smcap">Susan</span> support her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> Sit down, Miss Bird. The remedy is as
harmless as water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span> I am <i>so</i> nervous, let me go home. I read of
the girl that nearly died here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> (<i>Indignantly.</i>) No such thing ever happened,
I tell you. She only fainted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span> But papa doesn’t know what I’m doing.
He wouldn’t approve at all. And if anything more
should happen and <i>my</i> name get in the papers—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> Nothing can happen. How absurd. (<i>They
get <span class="smcap">Dickie</span> back in chair.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> <i>I</i> am nervous, too. If Mr. Compton ever
caught me here, oh dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> Mrs. Compton, I beg you will act rationally.
Go back to your pulleys! It is against the rules
for one patient to enter the room where another is being
operated on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. C.</span> Humph! I can hear the racket of all of ’em.
I’ll break that old machine. (<i>Exit D. F., noise of pulleys

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> (<i>Bows.</i>) You do. Won’t you come into
the reception room? It’s a mistake of the girl to show
you in here. Your name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss McF.</span> Miss McFadden. Since we are here I
think we can manage. I have but a moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span></p>

Miss McFadden?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> Complexion, perhaps?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss McF.</span> Exactly! My skin feels rather harsh at
times.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> You need my crowning discovery, the
wonderful skin food, followed by Pastilla di Pasta.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss McF.</span> I had thought of trying something of
the kind. (<i><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> showing vase of “food.”</i>) How much?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> Five dollars a jar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss McF.</span> Isn’t that rather expensive?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> Excuse me, it is worth twice the money.
I ought to charge ten dollars. The materials are very
costly, and the secret is invaluable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss McF.</span> I’ll take a jar! (<i>Gives money.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> (<i>Smiling.</i>) Anything else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss McF.</span> No, that is, yes, my sister has a wart
on her nose, which disfigures her slightly!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> That can easily be removed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss McF.</span> Will it leave a scar?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> Oh dear, no! I never leave a blemish! In
fact I improve on nature in her happiest moods, to such
a state of perfection has my art attained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss McF.</span> (<i>Has been writing in note book.</i>) Will it
be a painful operation?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mad. P.</span> Not at all! My customers actually enjoy
the various processes, just as they say men enjoy being
shaved and having their heads rubbed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss McF.</span> My sister may come in—(<i>Loud screams
L.</i>) What is that? (<i>Terrific crash back of flat. <span class="smcap">Susan</span>

<p class="center"><i>Time of playing, twenty minutes.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>—The only difficult part in this play is that
of Sol. Isaacstein. He is a Jew of the extreme type.
The best study is that of the typical Jew traveling
man who is not native born. Isaacstein’s dialect is of
course exaggerated, as all dialect must necessarily be
in farce. One useful hint may be given, i. e., try to get
an easy swing to it. To pronounce <i>der</i> gombany with
nicety of precision spoils the effect entirely. <i>Der</i> is
not plain <i>dare</i> in English. It is more indistinct so that
the <i>d</i> may be nearly a <i>t</i>. The same remarks apply to
the dialect of Adolphus.</p>

Jack are you there, an’ Tootsie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack.</span> I’m O.K. maw, Tootsie, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sol. I.</span> Boot me down O.K. (<i>O gay</i>) too. I set my
ziglone alarm, greatest invention of the age. Wendt
off an hour ago. Macher, I’ll sell you some stock; 50

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> Where’s Pattie Baggs?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. B.</span> I’m here, Mrs. Townsley. And I’m dyin’
o’ fright. Oh, I wish John was here!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> Do you want him here to be blown to
fiddle-strings in the cyclone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. B.</span> But he’s on the cyars and it may blow the
train off the track.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sol. I.</span> Tear laty, regomment him to my ziglone
ogsident bolicy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. B.</span> Oh, I shall faint if you go on that way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolph.</span> Deah me, is the stom so vewy violent as
that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jim F.</span> Well, I should say, Puterbaugh! Last cyclone
there was an old goose on a nest under the barn. It
blew those goose eggs, would you believe it, right
through the brick chimney. Holes in the brickwork
looked as if there had been a cannonade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span></p>

it ish not in it gombared to Dexas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jim F.</span> That’s what, Isaacstein. A cyclone’s not
bad. It’s a little exciting, but rather enjoyable when
you get used to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolph.</span> Weally, you don’t say! It must be vewy
twyin’ on the nerves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. B.</span> Oh my nerves, they’re twitchin’ forty ways
for Sunday.</p>

is a serious time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sol. I.</span> Mine frent, vat becomes of dot goose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jim F.</span> Oh the goose, that was the strangest thing
ever heard of. The cyclone blew that barn all to fliggets
and scattered it over half the county and it actooally
left that old goose settin’ on the same spot with
not a feather on her, an’ nary an egg under her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolph.</span> Did you evah heah the like?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. T.</span> (<i>To <span class="smcap">Pattie</span>.</i>) Jim Funk couldn’t stop

killed sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. B.</span> Oh goodness! If you talk of killing, you’ll

<p><span class="smcap">Town.</span> (<i>Severely.</i>) Mrs. Townsley, who is talking

in great balls, as big as your head, that danced round
the ground among the hailstones and melted away
slowly—them that didn’t explode. (<i>Lightning and another

<ul>
<li><span class="smcap">John Lawton.</span></li>

<p class="center"><i>Time of playing, one hour, forty minutes.</i></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Properties.</span></h3>

<p>Ring for Florence, money, architect’s plan, two pistols,
dishes, towels, skillet, stove for cabin, gun, card
tray, card, oranges in basket, two cots, blankets, newspaper,
cartridge belt.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Costumes.</span></h3>

<p>The costumes of this play are all “of the day” except
the make-up of <span class="smcap">Rogers</span> and <span class="smcap">Vance</span> in the mountains,
Act II. These are: Brown coarse overalls and
blouse or roundabout. (Blue will answer, but is not
right.) Cartridge belt when worn is heavy and full of
cartridges; slouch hats, black or white, to taste; very
heavy boots (not shoes), very dusty; overalls may be in
boot tops or not; for variety, one each way will do.
<span class="smcap">Vance</span> may have very long whiskers or stubble. <span class="smcap">Pay
Streak</span> is more juvenile and may be shaven. Face very
brown. Clothing greasy and smeared with clay.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Hints on Presentation.</span></h3>

<p>This play has been written from mining life and
hotel life as the author has actually found it, except<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
that miners employ a very energetic and picturesque
profanity which can not be reproduced in a play. One
caution is necessary in the characters of “Pay Streak”
and the “Rocky Mountain Grouse.” The man is not a
<i>clown</i> and the girl is not <i>coarse</i>. Miners are serious
people, and however ludicrous their conversation and
actions may appear to outsiders, to themselves it is
earnestness. A man who will stand up and die in defense
of his claim must be an earnest man. The other
characters need no special elucidation. Great care must
be taken, in the duel scene, to use blank cartridges.
Any mistake here may prove real tragedy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flossie.</span> What am I to do? (<i>Reads.</i>) “Meet me at
eight at the old oak by the spring.” The poor boy
doesn’t know that the grove is cut down and the whole
place built up with cottages. Five years since he left,
and we thought he was dead. He must be desperate
to come back like this and take the chance of meeting
father. Poor boy! Papa is so unrelenting. Snapped
Rachel up for even mentioning Herbert’s name once.
And he was always Rachel’s pet. Oh, if she doesn’t
find him! I ought to have gone myself, but I was afraid.
He’ll think that I, too, never forgave him. (<i>Moves
nervously.</i>) I can hardly wait till Rachel returns. If
she doesn’t find him—</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Mr. Lawton</span>, R.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> Daughter, is my paper here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> It is on the table, papa. (<i><span class="smcap">Law.</span> seats by table.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> Rachel is very careless lately. I always want
my paper in the library. I’ve spent half the time I had
to read looking for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> I’m very sorry, papa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> Florence, you don’t hold a very firm rein.
The servants run the house. (<i>Reading.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> But papa, Rachel has been here ever since I
can remember. Why shouldn’t she manage? She<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
knows everything about housekeeping much better
than I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> You are too easy, child. Your mother always
allowed herself to be imposed on through sheer good
nature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Why, papa, nobody imposes on me. Rachel
is almost a mother to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> You must be firm. It may do with Rachel,
but the others—(<i>looks up.</i>) Why Flossie, bless me,
what ails you? (<i><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> wipes eyes.</i>) I didn’t mean to
scold, but really—there now, never mind. Perhaps I
spoke too sharply.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Dear father, you have always been so good,
but—(<i>pause.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> (<i>Gazing at her.</i>) But what, Flossie? Don’t
mind me. I forgot that you are scarcely more than a
child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> (<i>With slight opposition.</i>) I’m <i>not</i> a child. I am
eighteen. I want to be treated as a woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> (<i>Laughs.</i>) Very well, Miss Florence Lawton,
what does my young lady want?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> I want—(<i>nervously</i>) I want a great deal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> All young ladies do nowadays. A new gown,
or diamonds possibly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Can’t a woman think of anything besides dress?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> Some women can’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> If mother were living and asked you something
seriously, you wouldn’t treat her that way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> (<i>Rises takes her hands tenderly.</i>) Child, there
is something on your mind, speak freely. As I see you
before me, I see the image of your dear mother. Flossie,
when you ask, you ask for <i>two</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Then, dearest papa, may I ask a very—very
great favor? So great that—I’m afraid to ask it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> (<i>Seriously.</i>) Why, my child, what is the
matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> (<i>Looks at him intently.</i>) Nothing much. (<i>With
feeling.</i>) Dear papa—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> Speak out. Am I such an ogre as to frighten
my own child. Why make so much ado about it?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
(<i>Pause.</i>) Florence, why don’t you speak? Has Mr.
Vance been disagreeable?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> (<i>With down-cast eyes.</i>) It isn’t Harvey—how
absurd—(<i>nervously</i>) Oh papa, do you think that—brother
Herbert—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> (<i>Hardening, short pause, then with effort.</i>)
Daughter, why do you wring my heart like this? That
name is forbidden in this house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> But Herbert is your son and my brother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> No, I have no son and you have no brother.
He disgraced us and then robbed us. He sent your
mother to her grave. (<i>With feeling.</i>) He is dead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> But if he were not dead?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> I know what you mean. But he is dead to us.
I had some months ago a letter from him which I
burned unopened. I’ve heard enough of his pretended
repentance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Oh papa—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> Has he written to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> He only begs forgiveness. He does not ask
for money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> Florence, I forbid you to communicate with
him or speak his name. If he comes back here the
prison is ready for him. Flossie, no disobedience,
remember.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Where are you going, papa?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> To the lodge. Good-bye. (<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Law</span>, R.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> What can I do? My duty is to a poor, needy,
erring brother as well as to my father. And papa is <i>so</i>
hard on that point.</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Rachel</span>, L.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> (<i>Breathlessly.</i>) Did you find him, Rachel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> Yes, the poor boy was that glad to see me,
he fairly hugged me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Where is he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> He came with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> That is dangerous, he may be seen here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> He would come. He must see you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> I wonder if I’d know him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> I’m afraid not, Miss Flossie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Is he so changed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> He looks thin an’ tired like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Poor Herbert! Did he ask about me or papa?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> You first! The poor child was wanderin’
round like a stray sheep. He didn’t know that the old
place was sold for lots. It seemed to make him sad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Rachel, what shall we do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> Did you speak to Mr. Lawton?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Yes, and papa frightened me. He seemed so
bitter—and so hurt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> I’ll tell him I think he is too harsh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> No, Rachel, leave that to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> Then Herbie will have to wait. If you don’t
mind my sayin’ it, he did act pretty bad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> But we must forgive, always, Rachel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> Land, haven’t I cried for him many’s the
time. Your mother and I often spoke of him between
ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Where is he now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> In the kitchen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> I’ll see him here. He shall never say that his
only sister received him in the kitchen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> But the risk, Miss Florence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Papa is at the lodge, and I expect no one this
evening. How does he look, Rachel? Do you think
I’ll know him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> I guess not. In fact, he’s desprit shabby.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Then we must give him some clothes. Papa
has plenty, and I think they are about of a size.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> Yes, I think they be. Shall I fix him up a
little?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Yes, get papa’s last year’s gray suit. I’ll be
there in a minute. I’ll see what money I have. (<i>Takes
out purse. Exit <span class="smcap">Rach.</span> L.</i>) Dear me! I’ve only a pitiful
two dollars and some silver. I’ve been too extravagant.</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Harvey Vance</span>, R.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> Good evening, Flossie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> (<i>Drops purse.</i>) Oh, Mr. Vance, you startled
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> (<i>Gallantly picks up pocket-book.</i>) <i>Mister Vance!</i>
You are very formal. I used to be Harvey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> (<i>Embarrassed.</i>) But I didn’t expect you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> Of course not. I thought I’d surprise you.
(<i>Notices her.</i>) Why, Flossie, are you ill? You are
trembling like a leaf. (<i>Be seated, offers to help her to a
seat; she gently repulses him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> (<i>Hesitates.</i>) I didn’t expect you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> I don’t see why my sudden appearance
should affect you that way, since we are to be married
in a month.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Pardon me, Harvey. I—I think I—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> (<i>Anxiously.</i>) My dear, you are ill! Do sit
down. (<i>She refuses as before.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> I am not ill—only—(<i>with effort</i>) I am cross
to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> (<i>Laughs lightly.</i>) If that is all I’ll talk you
into a good humor. I have the plan of our new house
here. It will be the finest on the hill. I’ve had that
staircase changed. I wish to see if it meets your approval.
It must go to the contractors by to-night’s
mail; that’s why I came.</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Rachel</span>, door L., then about to withdraw suddenly.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Rachel!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> Miss Florence? (<i>Putting in head again.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> I’ll give the orders later.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> Yes, Miss! (<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> (<i>Sits at table.</i>) Sit down, Flossie. This plan
has been altered since—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Harvey, please—I cannot look at the plan to-night!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> Why not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> I am not in the mood. Excuse me please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> But it must go immediately!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Send it! I don’t care about the changes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> But you did care.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> I don’t care now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance</span> (<i>Anxiously.</i>) Don’t care now? Our own
house? Why, Florence!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> I mean I can’t look at it now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> (<i>Rises.</i>) Florence, don’t you think you are
just a little bit capricious sometimes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> (<i>Nervously.</i>) Perhaps! Why not? Must a woman
smile always?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> Flossie, you don’t want to see me to-night,
that is plain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Harvey, you men are so exacting. There are
times when one wants to—to be let alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> There now! We’ll not quarrel. We have
never quarreled yet. I thought you’d like to see me—I
mean the plan. But you don’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Why don’t you show it to papa? He’s at the
lodge. Go and meet him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> I don’t think he is interested in it very
much. But I guess I’ll try it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> (<i>Pleased.</i>) Oh, do Harvey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> Florence, excuse my thoughtlessness. I have
intruded. I beg pardon. I see there are times when
even a man’s sweetheart isn’t interested in his plans.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> (<i>Coaxingly.</i>) Harvey, don’t be absurd.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> I am not absurd. I’ve only been thoughtless,
that’s all. (<i>Going R.</i>) Good night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Good night. (<i>Goes to door with him.</i>) I’m so
sorry. (<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Vance</span>, R.</i>) There’s a narrow escape and
what <i>will</i> Harvey think of me. I have actually been rude.
Why, he left his plan after all! (<i>Goes L., calls <span class="smcap">Rachel</span>.</i>)</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Rachel</span>, L.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> The coast is clear, Rachel, I actually feel
guilty. If papa should return—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> Shall I bring him in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Yes, be quick. (<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Rachel</span>, L.</i>) I must get
him away. To think that he must be driven like a
tramp from his own home.</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Herbert</span>, L. He advances and then stands with
down-cast look.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Oh Herbert, dear brother! (<i>Advances toward
him.</i>) Why, Herbie, can’t you speak to me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> (<i>Advances.</i>) Little Flossie!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Not so little now! (<i>Grasping both his hands, hesitates.</i>)
I thought you might kiss your sister.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> Flossie, can you forgive me? (<i>Kisses her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Am I not your sister?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> (<i>Admiring her.</i>) How you have grown! and
how pretty you are! Just the image of mother. (<i>Starts,
wipes away tear.</i>) Dare I ask her forgiveness, too? I
cannot look her in the face.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Oh Herbert!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> What is it, Flossie? How strange you look!
Where is mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> (<i>Takes him gently by the hand and leads him to portrait.</i>)
There!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> (<i>Looks at picture then at <span class="smcap">Flo.</span>, staggers to chair.</i>)
Dead! God forgive me, I killed her. (<i>Buries his face
in his hands.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> (<i>With handkerchief to eyes, in broken voice.</i>) Herbert,
we must all die. She is happy now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> And I, miserable wretch, repaid her love
with disobedience. I broke her heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> (<i>Gently takes his hand.</i>) Brother, have you
asked God to forgive you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> Yes, but my prayers are in vain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> No, God forgives, and she has forgiven. She
died with your name on her lips.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> (<i>Moved.</i>) I must go now. For months I have
dwelt upon the time when I could fall on my knees at
her side and ask her forgiveness. Now there is only
the hard world for me. And father—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> You must not see him yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> He is still relentless? I do not blame him,
but he might have written me that she was dead—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> We thought—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> (<i>Looks at her.</i>) You thought I was dead, too?
I wish I had died.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Herbert, you are still young, there is time yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> Too late. I know father too well. He never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
will forgive me. When I took mother’s jewels—that
turned his heart to stone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Dear brother, I will win him over if you give
me time. But he must know that you have truly repented.
What are you doing now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> God knows, I am trying. I have had hard
luck. I came to the door like a tramp. And here I am
in <i>his</i> clothes. I’d sooner beg than take them, but
Rachel made me put them on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> But you have been earning something.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> (<i>Bitterly.</i>) Something! Yes, fifteen dollars
per month in a livery stable and sleep in the stable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Oh Herbert!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> And I lost that job three months ago. Times
were so hard they couldn’t keep me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Have you no money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> (<i>Bitterly.</i>) Money! and out of work so long!
Florence, you don’t know the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> I’ll give you some. But I have so little, only
two dollars. Take that. (<i>Gives money.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> (<i>Smiling.</i>) I suppose you’ll think I want to
work the family for money. That is about all I ever
did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Nonsense, Herbie. I only wish I had more.
Isn’t there some friend?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> Friend! (<i>Laughs bitterly.</i>) <i>Friends!</i> Mine all
quit me when my money was done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> (<i>Suddenly.</i>) Oh, I know of one, he’ll help you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> I haven’t a friend in the world. Who is he,
Flossie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> (<i>Hesitating.</i>) A friend of—of the family. A
<i>good</i> friend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> (<i>Pause, he regards her.</i>) A very good friend?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Yes, the noblest friend in the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> (<i>Smiling.</i>) I begin to see, little sister. Going
to marry him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Yes, next month.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> Lucky fellow!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> And then papa will be lonely and he may—I’ll
try my best.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> He never will, not for years any way, if ever.
Who is your friend?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Harvey Vance. You don’t know him. He is
a new man who started a carriage factory here. He
doesn’t even know that I have a brother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> You had better tell him, Flossie. Don’t
keep anything back. He mightn’t like it if he heard
afterwards from some one else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> I don’t like to speak against you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> Then just say there is a black sheep in the
family. If he wants to know more, he’ll ask.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Oh, he is so honorable, he’d never ask; and
he’ll help you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> I’d rather work my own way. I look pretty
well in these clothes, though they are not exactly a fit.
The governor is stouter than he used to be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Papa is very well and strong.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> (<i>Laughs.</i>) Yes, and I imagine it wouldn’t
be healthy for me if he caught me here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Oh no, and—I can’t tell you—but you must
go. And you must leave town, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> I can’t leave town on two dollars unless I
tramp it. And that puts me back beyond hope. If I
could only get to Chicago. Times are improving and I
might get work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> How much do you need?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> I couldn’t do with less than twenty dollars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> And I’ve been such an extravagant little goose.
I’ve spent all my money. My jewels—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> (<i>Starting.</i>) Jewels! My God, don’t mention
jewels!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Pardon me Herbie, I forgot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> Rachel always has money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> But it is all in the savings bank. She deposited
to day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> I’ll wait till to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> No, no, you must not wait till to-morrow.
You must go to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> (<i>Bitter feeling returning.</i>) But why are you
all so anxious to get rid of me. I’ll go soon enough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> I can’t tell you! Papa—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> (<i>Starting.</i>) I remember now. (<i>Bitterly.</i>)
Prison! He threatened me. No, there is no place here
for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> There is no way but the jewels. Papa gave me
a necklace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> Never! I’ll never touch his money after that
threat. I’ll tramp first. Perhaps he’d like to have his
son a tramp. Perhaps the people of this town would
like to see me further disgraced, curse them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Herbert! Herbert, how can you speak so? But
you must go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> Yes, I must go. Ha! ha! I’ll go. The governor
will soon be back from the lodge and he—no I
can’t say anything against him for I have wronged him
too deeply. (<i>Pause, looks at her ring.</i>) Florence, that
ring is worth one hundred dollars. I could easy get
twenty on it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> But that is <i>his</i> ring, my engagement ring. I
couldn’t part with that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> No, of course not, Flossie. Forgive me for
suggesting such a thing. I’ll try to get along somehow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Go to the next town, keep quiet, and I’ll send
the money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> Everybody knows me there.</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Vance</span>, R., unobserved, stops surprised.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Of course! I could meet you somewhere.
(<i>Vance surprised stops.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> That might be arranged, but where?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> I’m afraid I couldn’t get away to-morrow.
(<i>Vance puzzled, moves as if to go out.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> Dear Flossie, I’ll leave it all to you. You
are my only hope. (<i>Vance struck with suspicion stops,
then stands like a statue.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Herbert, I shall never give you up, no matter
what happens. I think of you night and day. (<i>Vance
hand to head with gesture of anguish.</i>) Pshaw! this is no
time for hesitation. (<i>Takes off ring.</i>) Take this! If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
<i>he</i> misses it I’ll make some excuse. It’s easy enough
to put him off. (<i>They go L.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> (<i>With anguish, low tone.</i>) Oh God! <i>my</i> ring!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> (<i>Turns, sees <span class="smcap">V.</span>, screams.</i>) Oh! Mr. Vance, how
you startle me! Why did you come in that way?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> (<i>In husky voice.</i>) I startle you! Heaven
help me! What have <i>you</i> done to me? Stabbed me to
the heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Oh, Mr. Vance, please—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> Save your words, false woman, traitress,
shameless creature, you drove me away to meet <i>him</i>
here. (<i><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> totters back grasping chair. <span class="smcap">Vance</span> advances
in a furious passion.</i>) Oh the shame! Woman! woman!
(<i>She shrinks back speechless.</i>) I could strangle such a viper.
(<i>Drops his hands, head falls on breast.</i>) No, I can’t strike
her for I loved her. Traitress, farewell! (<i><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> drops
senseless.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> Help! Rachel! (<i>Dropping on knees beside
<span class="smcap">Flo.</span>, raises her head.</i>) Coward! Wretch! You shall
answer for this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> (<i>With passionate scorn and deliberation.</i>) Yes,
I’ll answer, and I’ll kill you at sight like a dog.</p>

stove and cot; rough pine table down C., with

threading needle and tangling thread.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> That pesky thread is enough to rile ole Job,
I reckon. It takes my pard to sew on buttons. He
goes at it ’sif he’d been a tailor in his time. He’s the
coolest cuss in camp anyway. Wy, when we struck it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
rich in the “Little Lucy” lode what did he do? Jump
round an’ holler an’ say, “Boys, we’ve got it bigger’n
an elephant?” Nary time; jest said, “I ’low if it holds
out we’re pretty well heeled.” Didn’t seem to care
whether it held out or not. Bet yer boots <i>I</i> care. I’ve
been poor as a church mouse too long not to care. What
did I do when I seen the assay went $500 to the ton?
Wy, I jist slipped over to ole man Baker’s place an’
asked the Grouse if she’d like to hitch. I was afraid
o’ that cuss from Tenderfoot Gulch, that Lonesome
Mose. He’s struck it, too. What d’ye s’pose she said?
“Pay Streak, what does she go to the ton?” “Five hundred,
Mollie,” sez I, awful anxious, fur I didn’t know
what Mose’s assay showed. An says the Grouse, “I’ll
think about it, Jim.” Called me Jim instead o’ Pay
Streak. I couldn’t stand that, an’ cust if I didn’t
give her a smack ’at sounded like a giant cap bustin’.
She didn’t git very mad, an’ then I knowed it was good
as settled. (<i>Pulls at thread and breaks it.</i>) Cuss that
thread! I reckon that’ll hold till Mollie takes charge
o’ my traps. (<i><span class="smcap">Lawton</span> raps at door, with cane, R.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> Come in, stranger!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> Is this Vance &amp; Rogers’ place?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> It is; step right in; there ain’t no call to
rap at any miner’s door in the Rocky Mountains, but of
course you don’t know that, bein’ a tenderfoot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> Oh, yes, I know that a miner’s door is always
open. Are you Rogers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> Correct y’are! Squat. (<i>Wipes off chair with
towel.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> This is just as good. (<i>Seats himself on one of
logs, <span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> on the other.</i>) Are you the man they call
Pay Streak?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> That’s my sobriquet (<i>sobrikwet</i>), as the editor
calls it. The boys called me Pay Streak because I’ve
a way o’ askin’ how wide the pay streak is when they
git to talkin’ about their claims. I al’ays look at the
pay streak first. A man’s the same as a mine; when
ye’ve seen the width of his pay streak, ye’ve got his
measure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> It’s not a bad name, either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> Becherlife it aint. Some sense in it. Now if
they’d called me Lonesome Mose as they do that inexorable
cuss over in Tenderfoot Gulch I’d a killed
a few of them jist to change my luck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> I hear you boys have struck it rich.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> Bigger’n a four-hoss team an’ band wagon,
stranger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> Let me see, what is your partner’s full name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> Vance! Harvey Vance! The boys call him
“Old Silence” ’cause he says mighty little an’ don’t
talk no minin’ guff about his claims.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> Where does he hail from?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> Illinois.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> Where is he to-day? I believe I know him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> (<i>Jumping up.</i>) What! you know my pard,
stranger! Now why did ye go beatin’ round the bush?
That aint a square deal! Why didn’t ye jist walk in an’
hang up yer hat? Take that there chair! No, but ye
must. (<i>Law takes chair.</i>) We haint much hyur, but all
we got belongs to any friends o’ Old Silence. Scuse
me, I mean your friend Vance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> Oh, that’s all right, no apologies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> Stranger, I’m <i>cussed</i> glad to see you. Shake!
Wy, we’ve been hyur two year and never a soul come
along that was an <i>old</i> friend. I’ve a whole raft o’ kin
in Missouri, but none of ’em drifts to this camp. You
kin bet yer liver, pard’ll be glad to see ye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> I hope so, it’s a good while since I saw him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> I’ll bet my share in the Little Lucy—an’ we
was offered $100,000 last week fur it—that my pardner
haint any friends he’s ashamed of.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> No, he isn’t that kind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> That’s straight! ye can’t tell me nothin’
about him an’ his outfit. Anything he says goes, on
this hill. That’s ’cause he doesn’t say much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> Where is Mr. Vance to-day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> I was jist wonderin’ myself, when you
dropped in. The gun aint gone so I ’low he isn’t far
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> Could I have a short talk with him privately?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> Could you talk with him privately? Stranger,
hain’t I jist said this place was your’n. When he comes
I’ll vamoose quick, savvy? I ’low he’s out at the Lucy
lookin’ at the truck. Pard, it’s good fur sore eyes to
look at that truck, $500 to the ton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> I might walk out and meet him, if you don’t
object.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> <i>Ob</i>ject! Stranger, really ye’re not talkin’
on the square. How could I <i>ob</i>ject. Wy, the mountain’s
your’n! Everything in sight is your’n!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> Thank you, Pay Streak! By the way, what
is your full name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> Rogers, Jim Rogers. I’ll take ye to the Lucy.
No, I recken you want to see him private. (<i>Goes to
door.</i>) Well, foller the path straight ahead about two
hundred yards.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> Thank you, Mr. Rogers. I’ll see you again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> Krect. (<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Law</span> R.</i>) I’ll bet he’s a financer
an’ wants to buy the Little Lucy. Well, he can’t.
She has a pay streak wuth talkin’ about, two feet wide
an’ five hundred to the ton. (<i>Looks out.</i>) Great guns,
if they aint ladies a comin’! Wonder if they’ll stop
here fur a drink o’ water or anything? I haint been in
society sence I left Missouri. I’ll be shot if it aint the
Grouse an’—an’ a strange lady. The Grouse is comin’
to take us by s’prise. This place is in a nice ruction
fur company. Haint made my bed yet. (<i>Runs to bed
R., turns up the blankets and tries to smooth out the pillow.</i>)
That pillar’s harder’n one o’ Lonesome Mose’s flapjacks.
(<i>Hammers at pillow.</i>) Ought ter been filled at the sawmill
long ago. An’ that towel aint been washed fur
a month. (<i>Flips towel under the bed.</i>) I’ll git one o’
Vance’s towels. (<i>Takes clean towel out of cupboard and
hangs it across chair back.</i>) Pard’s a purty good cook
but he aint in it washin’ dishes. Them plates looks
tough. (<i>Picks up plates from table, drops knife, picks that
up and drops plate, which breaks.</i>) Damn it! (<i>Picks up
pieces, throws the whole into cupboard with a bang, closes
door.</i>) Look at that skillet, an’ fried onions, too,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
scentin’ the whole mountain. Wher’n thunder kin I
put them? I guess that’s about the place fur them.
(<i>Tosses skillet out of window.</i>) There, I s’pose that’s the
best I kin do on short notice. (<i>Sits on log and pretends
to be reading old soiled paper, rap at door.</i>) Come in!</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Grouse</span> and <span class="smcap">Flo.</span></i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Hello, Mr. Rogers!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> Well, I’ll be—(<i>catches himself</i>) this is a
s’prise, Grouse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Miss Baker if you please, Mr. Rogers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> (<i>Surprised.</i>) Oh—of course! Excuse <i>me</i>.
No offense I hope, <i>Miss</i> Baker.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Mr. Rogers, let me <i>interduce</i> Miss Lawton.
She’s travelin’ to see the mountains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> (<i>Bows awkwardly.</i>) I’m awful glad to see
you, Miss Lawton. <i>You</i> take the chair. Grouse, I reckon
you’ll have to squat on a log.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> (<i>Sitting on table.</i>) Jim Rogers, where’s
yer manners? Nicknames don’t go afore company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> No, of course not. (<i>To <span class="smcap">Flo.</span></i>) I beg pardon,
Miss Lawton, but ye see all the miners called her the
Rocky Mountain Grouse, long ago when she was a little
tot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> (<i>Making face.</i>) Long ago! I like that.
I s’pose I’m old Methusalem now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> (<i>Embarrassed.</i>) Now looky hyur, Grouse—I
mean Miss Mollie Baker, what ails ye? I didn’t mean
nothin’. Ye’re techy as powder to-day. (<i>To <span class="smcap">Flo.</span></i>)
Excuse <i>me</i>, Miss, but I’m a little off on talkin’ to
ladies. Haint been in society sence I left Joplin,
Missouri, five years ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Oh, don’t be formal, Mr. Rogers, I like the
mountain ways.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> Wy, to be sure, the mountains is best, lots
of room, lots of rocks, lots of—of everything. I say,
Miss Lawton, kin I show you Little Lucy? She’s a
daisy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> (<i>Surprised.</i>) Little Lucy! I don’t understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Pay Streak, you <i>are</i> a greeny. What d’ye<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
s’pose the lady knows about your lingo. (<i>To <span class="smcap">Flo.</span></i>)
The Little Lucy’s a mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> (<i>Laughing.</i>) I should be delighted to see Lucy
but I can not to-day, thank you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> Oh well, any day’ll do. Besides my pardner,
I reckon he could talk to ye. He’s a lady’s man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> (<i>Nervously.</i>) Oh no! I saw the mines at Leadville.
I just wanted to say that there’s a man looking
for Mr.—for your partner and—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> Yes, Miss, I told him where to find him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> (<i>Trying to appear calm.</i>) You told him! Miss
Baker, they musn’t meet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Now you <i>have</i> done it, Jim. They were
lookin’ fur each other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> Holy Moses! How did I know they was
lookin’ fur each other?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Pay Streak, have you been in the mountains
five years an’ don’t know what a man means when
he says he’s <i>lookin’</i> fur somebody? You don’t know
enough to pound sand in a rat hole.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> (<i>Scratching his head.</i>) Well, I don’t, ladies,
an’ that’s a fact. Why cuss it! (<i>To <span class="smcap">Flo.</span></i>) Excuse <i>me</i>,
Miss, I may haf to actooally swear afore this job’s over.
But how could I know that that slick chap was <i>lookin’</i>
fur pard? He only said he wanted to see him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Well, he mustn’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Oh no, Mr. Rogers—I—I can’t tell you why,
but they must not meet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> (<i>Bowing awkwardly.</i>) Bet yer life you don’t
need to tell why. When a lady says she wants a thing
that’s enough fur me. I aint askin’ why. (<i>Admiring
glance at <span class="smcap">Grouse</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Then don’t stand like a dummy. Git a gait
on an’ stop ’em afore—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> Wont I, great guns! (<i>Gets revolver and belt
from under pillow.</i>) I’ll stop ’em if I have to take a
hand in the game myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> (<i>Alarmed.</i>) Oh no, Mr. Rogers! Please don’t
do that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> (<i>Surprised.</i>) No? Then I wont. I’ll jist<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
argy pardner out of it; I aint much on talk, but I’m
used to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> An’ I’ll be so grateful!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> Don’t mention it, Miss. (<i>Struck with idea.</i>)
I’ll convince pardner an’ then we’ll both convince
tother chap if we have to pump him full o’ lead to do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Oh, not that, either. You must not do anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> (<i>Puzzled.</i>) Well, I’ll be—this <i>is</i> a puzzler.
I give it up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Why don’t you go, Jim? Don’t stand there
like a mud hen on a log.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> I’ll vamoose instanter, savvy? (<i>Exits hastily
R.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Miss Baker, you’ll think this very strange.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Not a bit, Miss. I’ve been there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> (<i>Surprised.</i>) But I mean—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Never mind. Jim’ll straighten it all out.
And if you don’t want to meet Mr. Vance, you’d better
skip right off, fur he’s liable to turn up any minnit.
There haint been no shootin’ yet or we’d heard it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Oh, I’m so glad. I’ll go now and you wait
to bring me word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> But you may meet tother one on the mountain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> I want to meet him. One word would fix it
all right. (<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Well, I never! These fine ladies play a
big game. Keeps both on the hooks till they git
fightin’ mad an’ then goes tearin’ round tryin’ to make
peace. Humph! Wants to meet tother one. Well, I
s’pose <i>he’s</i> the one an’ Vance gits left. I’m awful sorry
for Vance fur he’s <i>white</i> an’ Jim likes him awful well.
(<i>Sits on table and swings feet.</i>) That comes o’ havin’ too
many fellers at onct. I’ve been there, but I reckon I
shipped Lonesome Mose jist in time. Good Lord, only
think o’ Pay Streak an’ Lonesome Mose cavortin’ round
the mountains lookin’ for each other. Why, it makes
Jim hot fur me even to mention Mose. There’s a good
deal worse than Mose, but I wouldn’t look at him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
beside Jim. I’ve been dreamin’ o’ Jim ever since we
led the ball at Cottonwood Pass two years ago last
winter. If anything ’ud happen Jim—well, the Rocky
Mountain Grouse wouldn’t fly so high, that’s all. But
it wouldn’t do for me to tell him all that. A little at
a time kind o’ keeps a man lookin’ for more an’ then
Jim’s sort o’ gone on himself an’ it would make him
sassy. (<i>Looks out.</i>) Why, there he comes runnin’.</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Pay S.</span>, R.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> (<i>Breathlessly.</i>) Run all the way an’ back.
Can’t find ’em nowhere. Where’s she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Gone. She’s a sly one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> There yer off yer lead. She’ll run away up
on assay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> I didn’t mean that. She’s playin’ two
suckers at onct, I guess.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> I don’t b’lieve it. That woman’s no coquette
(<i>cokwet</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Why, she said so herself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Fact! But she’s had a lesson. She’s run to
the end of the tether an’ she knows which ’un she’ll
take.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> Then it’s my pard, sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Taint nether.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> Why, tother one is old enough to be her pap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Don’t care if he is. Them city gals don’t
care fur age. They jist look at the rocks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> Well, pardner’ll have plenty of stuff when
we git the Lucy goin’ two shifts a day. Say, Grouse,
why didn’t ye mention that to her an’ say a good word
fur pardner?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Mention that! To her! Land o’ twilight!
It’s a heap you know about women.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> (<i>Puts arm round her waist.</i>) I know they are
sweeter than all creation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> (<i>Withdrawing.</i>) Oh, you do, do you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> (<i>Shoving closer to her on table.</i>) I mean there’s
one that is ole peaches an’ honey. (<i>Tries to kiss her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> (<i>Slaps him, but not very defiantly.</i>) Pay
Streak, I al’ays thought you’d some sense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> Bet yer boots <i>I</i> know a good thing. Say,
I’m awful sorry for pard. I cotton to that gal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Indeed! Then I’d better clear the way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> (<i>Hastily.</i>) I mean fur him. I believe she’s
actooally good enough fur him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> It’s no use. He is off the lead. Tother
chap’s campin’ on the claim. All ye kin do now is
keep him away from tother one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> How’ll I do it? Where the deuce is pardner,
anyway? He went out after breakfast an’ never
said anything about goin’ away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> We’ll fix up a scheme. I’m sort o’ sorry
for her. She’s awful anxious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> (<i>Enthusiastically.</i>) Yes, I’d do anything fur
her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> (<i>Looks meaningly.</i>) Oh, indeed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> I mean fur your sake, Mollie. Say, it’s awful
nice to call you Mollie, savvy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Jim, ye’re silly. Why don’t you try to
think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> I jist can’t when you are hyur. You think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Well, where do you guess Vance is?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> You didn’t meet him goin’ to town, so he
must ’a gone over the mountain to look at the Jumbo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Then I’ll tell ye what to do. You take
the gun an’ meet him an’ say that the jumpers are after
pap’s claim again over in the basin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> He’ll want me to go ’long then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Tell him you are goin’ back to camp fur
more men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> I’ll be cust! The very thing. (<i>Gets gun.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> An’ do hurry. I’ll wait till you come
back. I’m gittin’ skeered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> Don’t you worry. Jist let any body sass you
an’ I’ll—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Do go on, quick! (<i>Pushes him out.</i>) It’s
downright silly the way men act about women, wantin’
to shoot and sayin’ they’ll die. Humph! An’ a woman,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
she can’t do nothin’ but git scart an’ cry an’ carry
on. I do hope he’ll git Vance away. It serves her
right, though, to git a good scare; she’ll know how it
is herself. (<i>Knocking at door, <span class="smcap">Grouse</span> starts.</i>) Come in!</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Herbert</span> at door.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> Whose cabin is this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> It’s Rogers &amp; Vance’s, owners of the
Little Lucy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> Is Mr. Vance around?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> He ain’t fur away, I guess. Will Rogers
do? He’s jist gone. I kin call him back, but he’s in
a powerful hurry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> Don’t call him, I’ll drop in again. Could
you give me a drink of water?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Certingly, come in! (<i><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> steps inside, she
gets dipperful of water from pail, he drinks.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> Thank you, very much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Don’t mention it. (<i>Looks at him.</i>) You’re
a tenderfoot, I guess!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> (<i>Smiles.</i>) Yes, that is, I have been in Colorado
only six months. They told me of this Vance
over at Dead Man’s Gulch. (<i>Rests foot on log.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Did you want to see him pertickler?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> Rather particular, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> If it’s business, Rogers knows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> It’s a private matter. Perhaps he is at the
Lucy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> He’s most likely at the Jumbo. Take the
trail straight up an’ it’s jist over the ridge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> Thank you, I’ll meet him perhaps. Good day.
(<i>Exit <span class="smcap">H.</span>, R.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Pr’aps ye wont. I wonder who’ll be wantin’
Vance next? He’s peaceable, I guess. Wants to buy
the mine mebbe. If he had been an old man—(<i>Pause.</i>)
Great Jerusalem! I’ll bet we’re clean off the lead, digging
away in country rock. S’pose that is the feller
’at’s <i>lookin</i> fur Vance. <i>That</i> gal wouldn’t leave no
young feller like Vance fur an old man. An’ I’ve <i>told</i>!
Well, I’m a bigger fool than I said Jim was. (<i>Runs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
around.</i>) <i>I’m</i> excited now! This is a case, sure! Minds
me of the time Slim Jim shot Club Foot Pete fur cheatin’
at kyards, when pap kep’ the tavern at Cottonwood
Pass. Pap was jist reachin’ fur his gun when Pete kind
o’ staggered an’ threw up his hands like that, and says
he: “Baker, I’m done fur—I pass.” Them was his last
words.</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Pay S.</span>, excitedly, R.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> I can’t find nobody nowhere!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Pay Streak, you’re a fool!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> (<i>Nettled.</i>) S’pose I am, what’s the use o’
tellin’ me every five minutes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Cause you are, you can’t see an inch from
yer nose. Wat did ye say he was an <i>old</i> man, fur?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> Cause he was!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> He aint ether, an’ we might a knowed it.
He’s been hyur, an’ he’s a young feller.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> A young feller lookin’ fur my pardner?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Yes, lookin’ fur him pertikler.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> When it comes to that, if there’s any fly
young feller ’round this hill lookin’ fur somebody,
he’ll find a man sure. Mebbe he’ll find <i>me</i> afore he
quits. If he wants a scrap, he needn’t wear out shoe
leather lookin’ fur it in Ruby Camp.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> (<i>Seriously.</i>) Pay Streak, don’t you take
up nobody else’s rows till ye haf to. You’ll find
enough o’ yer own in this world. I’ve seen more o’
these mountains than you have. Pap kep’ tavern fur
years at the Pass, an’ I’ve seen shootin’ scrapes
enough. I seen Club Foot Pete killed, an’ it’s an awful
sight when it’s right afore yer eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> I ain’t a lookin’ fur anybody.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> But what’ll we do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> We’ve got to do somethin’.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> Well, Mollie, wat’s your idee?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Go down to camp right away, an’ tell pap
an’ git some o’ the miners out. Pretend it’s jumpers
over in the Basin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> Will you go ’long to camp?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> No, I’ll wait hyur for Vance. If he comes
I’ll send him to the Basin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> (<i>Going.</i>) I’ll round ’em up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> An’ give that strange feller a tip that it
’ud be healthier fur him to take the next stage back to
Dead Man’s Gulch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pay S.</span> Stage! Humph! walkin’s good that direction.
(<i>Exit hurriedly R.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Men’s all fools, I guess. Fightin’ about
claims an’ women as if there wasn’t plenty o’ both to
go round. Women’s bigger fools to egg ’em on. I
needn’t brag, ether. S’pose I’d drawed on Lonesome
Mose a little furder, there’d been music in camp.</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Vance</span>, R.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> Hello, Grouse, you here!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> I guess so, ye see me, don’t ye?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> I have that pleasure. (<i>She courtsies.</i>) You
are waiting to see Jim of course. Where is that boy,
anyway?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> (<i>With toss of head.</i>) Waitin’ fur Jim. I
guess not. When I wait fur a man I wait at home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> Of course, Miss Baker, no offense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Where in creation have <i>you</i> been all
mornin’?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> I felt out of sorts and I went over to the
mineral spring to take a good drink of that water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> I’ll bet you are the first man in Ruby Camp
that ever walked two miles fur a drink o’ water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> I like to watch the silver bubbles boiling
up from the clear depths.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Well, <i>I</i> don’t go much on them silver bubbles.
The silver in em’s too thin. Did ye meet anybody?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> (<i>Laughs.</i>) Yes, Lonesome Mose going to
his claim. He looks lonesomer than ever, lately.
(<i>Meaning look at her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Humph! Lonesome Mose! I mean, didn’t
ye meet nobody at all?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> Nobody else. (<i>At stove.</i>) Any one lookin’
for me? Where’s our skillet? I want to get dinner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> (<i>Impatiently.</i>) I don’t know nothin’ about
yer ole skillet. Say, Mr. Vance, did you know any
young ladies in Illinois?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> (<i>Surprised.</i>) Why, to be sure, plenty of
them. (<i>Looking.</i>) What on earth has become of that
skillet? I’m as hungry as a wolf.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> That’s like a man, he’d haf to eat if he
died next minnit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> He’d die if he didn’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Dyin’ with yer boots on aint so funny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> (<i>Surprised.</i>) Why, what do you mean, Miss
Baker. You seem excited.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> (<i>Laughs.</i>) I aint the kind to git excited
bad. (<i>He looks inquiringly.</i>) An’ ye don’t know any
<i>pertickler</i> young lady?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> (<i>With serious tone.</i>) Mollie, every man in
his time has known some <i>particular</i> young lady. Sometimes
she is too particular and sometimes not particular
enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> I guess this un’s jist about right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> (<i>Starting.</i>) What do you mean, Mollie?
Any lady in camp that knows me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> (<i>Laughing.</i>) It ’pears so. She’s been hyur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> Here! Did she want to see me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> No, she <i>didn’t</i> want to see you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> Then why the deuce did she come here!
There’s some mistake. (<i>Turns to look for skillet.</i>) I
wish Jim would let the cooking outfit alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Never mind yer ole skillet. I thought
mebbe you’d meet her on the road.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> (<i>At cupboard.</i>) Jim is very careless. He
has been chucking things round again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> You’re a nice man to prefer a skillet to a
young lady.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> (<i>Surprised.</i>) Excuse me, Grouse, I thought
we were good enough friends to be informal. I’ll not
look for the skillet any more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> I’m talkin’ about her. She was a bute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> Since she did <i>not</i> want to see me I hardly
think I am interested in her beauty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> It’s too funny that you didn’t meet anybody.
They’re lookin’ fur you all over the mountain
to go to the Basin. Jim said ye must go right off.
The Leadville outfit is tryin’ to jump pap’s claim
agin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> I don’t believe that. It must be a false
report.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> But it aint! Git yer gun and take the
trail. Ye kin git dinner at Jack’s cabin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> Why Mollie, Lonesome Mose was in the
Basin yesterday and he says the Leadville gang have
all gone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> (<i>With petulance.</i>) Lonesome Mose, indeed!
As if pap didn’t know better about his own claim.
Would you put Mose Randall’s word up agin’ pap’s er
a lady’s?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> Well, Mollie, I didn’t mean to contradict
you. I’ll enquire as soon as I get a bite to eat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> An’ yer goin’ to wait to eat?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> Yes, I’ll take a snack.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Some men ’ud eat if an earthquake was
comin’.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> I can easily catch them before they get to
Jack’s cabin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> An’ ye wont go now? Oh do, please, Mr.
Vance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> I don’t see the necessity of starving.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> Ever try it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Please don’t wait, Mr. Vance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> It won’t take fifteen minutes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> Well, they’s no use tryin’ to do anything
with a man—or a mule. I’ve got to do something.
(<i>Starts hastily.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> What’s the rush? Hold on, Miss Baker.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grouse.</span> I wont! (<i>Exit R.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> What on earth ails the Grouse. She always
was a kitten and I’m afraid she has a temper. Jim’ll<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
have to hold a pretty steady rein. (<i>Looking round for
skillet.</i>) I guess that skillet has taken wings. There’s
Jim’s dirty towel under the bed and my clean one on
the chair back. There has been some one here I guess.
I wonder if any sneak thief has paid us a visit? (<i>Looks
at <span class="smcap">Jim’s</span> pillow.</i>) His revolver is gone. (<i>Looks at his
own cot.</i>) Mine is all right. (<i>Puts his pistol on table.</i>)</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Herbert</span> knocks at door.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> Is this Mr. Vance’s place?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> My name is Vance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> (<i>Advances. With meaning.</i>) I’ve been looking

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> I guess you know my business. A lady’s honor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> (<i>Starting.</i>) A lady’s honor! (<i>Recognizes him.</i>)

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> I come from her to demand an explanation

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> Hold! Don’t waste words, Mr. Vance.
What you say of me can be settled some other time.
On her behalf—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> And you insult me with the mention of that
heartless, base woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> (<i>With deep, quiet indignation.</i>) Stop or I’ll kill
you on the spot. (<i>Draws pistol.</i>) Only blood can wipe
out that insult.</p>

meeting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> Are you armed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> (<i>Taking up pistol.</i>) As good a 38 as ever
came to the camp. We’ll go up into the pine woods.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> Why not here in front of your cabin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> We may be interrupted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> Exactly! I am already suspected and warned
to leave camp instantly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> (<i>Closes door, fastens it with latch.</i>) Take
your place at the door. (<i><span class="smcap">V.</span> goes to opposite wall.</i>) I’ll

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> Head!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> (<i>Tossing coin on table.</i>) Head! (<i>tosses</i>) tail!

doors in flat C.; piano by wall, R.; settee by wall, L.,
table C. littered with old periodicals, and some oranges in
basket; R. R., and steamship advts. on the walls; chairs

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Rachel, how do you like your first experience
down South?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel.</span> It is all so odd.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Are you enjoying it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> Oh, so much. I always wanted to travel. I
never hoped to get such a trip as this. The trees and
everything are so different.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> It is much stranger still in Mexico; if you
could only have seen that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> I’ll never forget your kindness in giving me
this trip.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Thank papa, Rachel, I was selfish and didn’t
want any maid. It looks foolish for a girl like me to
have a maid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> It’s no harm. Mr. Lawton wants you to get
strong again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> (<i>Rather sadly.</i>) Rachel, don’t you think I am
strong?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> Oh, yes! You look much better lately.</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Mr. Law.</span>, D. F.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> I’ve been looking for you, daughter. What
is your programme for to-day? A drive or a sail?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> I don’t care which, papa, I enjoy everything
that pleases you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> But I want you to choose for yourself. I am
such an old traveler I have seen about everything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> What do you say, Rachel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> Laws! Miss Flossie, it ain’t for me to choose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> But what do you like? Are you afraid of the
water?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> I don’t know. Do they get sea sick?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> Not on the river. Florence, they are catching
chameleons now in the garden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flo.</span> Oh, I want to see them! (<i>Exit D. F.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> So do I! (<i>Going D. F.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> Rachel!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> Sir!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> Come here, I want to speak to you. I have
made an important discovery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> Land sakes! none of the trunks missing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> (<i>Laughs.</i>) The trunks are all right. I’ve
found somebody here that Florence knows!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> Who?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> That Colorado partner of—of you know whom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> Dear me! how’d he get so far?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> He is here on his wedding trip. In this hotel.
Do you think Flossie would like to meet them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> I don’t know. It might worry her and—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> Recall the old times! Just what I thought.
But then, she might be glad to see them. They were
very kind to her. Rough people, but good as gold.
He is putting on style. Best rooms in the house!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> Hadn’t we better keep clear of them for a
day or two and sort of prepare her for it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> But how can you in a hotel like this? Everybody
sees everybody else. If we weren’t fatigued already,
I’d go on to Lake Worth to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> Then the best way is to ask her right out,
whether she cares to see them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> I know her answer. She’ll think it a duty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> The sooner the better then, I think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Law.</span> Very well, I’ll go and talk to her. (<i>Exit D. F.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> Well aint that odder’n Dick’s hatband! The
idee of meeting people from the four quarters of the
globe. These tourists seem to keep on forever running
to and fro on the earth. How can they afford it?
Money goes like water! I never dreamed o’ such expense!
(<i>Sees oranges on table.</i>) And an orange here<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
aint nothin’ more than a potato was where I was raised.
I’m going to take one! (<i>Takes orange.</i>)</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Herb.</span>, suddenly, D. F.; <span class="smcap">Rachel</span>, surprised, looks
guilty and starts out quickly, D. F.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> (<i>Excitedly.</i>) Rachel!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> Mr. Herbert—what is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> Where’s Flossie? (<i>Lowering voice.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> In the garden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> I must find her at once! It is very important.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> Yes, I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> You know! Have you seen <i>him</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> Him? Who?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> Why Vance, of course!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> (<i>Startled.</i>) Mercy me! Mr. Herbert, is he
here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> Yes, and may meet her any minute!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> (<i>Excitedly.</i>) That might give her a relapse.
She’s awfully nervous yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> I know it. What can we do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> We must get her away at once!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> I have a different idea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> What is that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> I’ll make him explain his conduct or—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> Oh Herbie, please don’t think of that!
Remember what happened before! Those miners are
dreadful men! He’ll kill you, sure!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> He’ll not get a chance! I’ll get the drop
and he can apologize or do worse. I’ll find him at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> Oh Herbert, don’t. (<i>Grasps his arm.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> Let me go. I’ll not endure such an insult
to my sister. As long as he took me for some one else
he had an excuse, but now that he knows I am her
brother, his conduct is infamous. (<i>Going D. F.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> (<i>Trying to restrain him.</i>) But your father—speak
to him first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> Father would call him to account if they met.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> But he would not hurt your father. They
never quarreled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> He shall answer for his conduct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> Oh, think of her—she loves him yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herb.</span> I am thinking of her. The traitor! (<i>Goes
hurriedly D. F. pushing <span class="smcap">Rachel</span> aside.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rach.</span> (<i>Excitedly.</i>) What shall I do? Oh, where is
Mr. Lawton? Another such shock will kill her. I
must find Mr. Lawton immediately. (<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Rach.</span> rapidly
as</i></p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Rogers</span> and <span class="smcap">Wife</span>, L., runs against <span class="smcap">R.</span>, and
drops orange.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> Beg pardon, madam! (<i>She never stops.</i>) Cuss
it, that gal’s crazy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> Jim, you must quit swearin’.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> I’m tryin’ my level best. Cuss it isn’t swearin’
at all. Say, Mollie, aint this great?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> What’s great?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> Why, this country an’ everything. Oranges
right on the trees till they’re yaller as gold, an’ strawberries
in February. (<i>Picks orange from floor.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> I haint seen any strawberries, Jim. They’re
not on the table.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> Well no, of course not. They go north to
sell. Ye couldn’t expect to see ’em on the table.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> Why not? What’s the use of havin’ money
if it won’t buy things as soon as other people gets ’em
an’ as good?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> I reckon that’s right, but ye see these Floridy
people figger both ways. The hotel makes ye pay fur
the berries jist the same as if ye got ’em an’ then sells
’em fur market. Savvy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> I’m sick an’ tired o’ bacon an’ canned stuff.
Had ’em all my life in the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> But Mollie, jist think o’ the other curus
things, the palmettos an’ the alligators—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> We can’t eat the alligators.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> But we kin take one home in a cigyar box.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> Indeed we wont. It makes me tired to
see people trottin’ round with a lot o’ hand bags and
Florida canes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> Made in New York—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> An’ alligators in boxes, smellin’ like fury.
Women doin’ it, too! An’ fussin over chameleons an’
carryin’ green cocoanuts home. As if sich things were
of any account out o’ their right place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> There’s another thing, Mollie, ’at makes me
still tireder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> What’s that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> Eatin’ fish. We’ve had ’em three times a day
ever sence we’ve been in Floridy. I reckon we’ll haf
to eat all the fish in Injun river, an’ there’s a slew of
’em. Wy, a man told me this mornin’ ’at sometimes
they was so thick in the river that ye couldn’t row a
boat. Oars jist slipped over solid fish as if the river
was greased.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> Jim, that man took you fur a tenderfoot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> Mebbe so. As I don’t know much about Floridy
I couldn’t dispute him, but I up an’ told him about
that time the mountain lions were so plenty in the
Gunnison country ’at we had to kick ’em away from
round the fire afore we could git breakfast, an’ we
couldn’t tell when it thundered fur their infernal roarin’.
I put that at him as a sort of a feeler.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> Jim, I’m sick o’ the whole business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> (<i>With feeling.</i>) Say now, Mollie, ye don’t
mean it. On yer weddin’ trip an’ tired of it? (<i>Caressing
her.</i>) Mollie, ye don’t mean <i>me</i> too, do you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> (<i>Smiling.</i>) No, Jim, I don’t mean you,
but I’m tired bein’ stared at an’ pointed out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> Wy Mollie, d’ye s’pose they’re onto our
racket?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> Jim, your slang is dreadful. Can’t you
drop a little of it. Of course everybody can see that
we are bride and groom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> How on earth can they tell?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> Humph! An’ you that spoony—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> Then it’s me that makes ye tired, an’ my
ways. (<i>Sadly.</i>) Mollie, you don’t know what you have
said. Ye’re ashamed o’ me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> No, I am not, Jim. I am not ashamed of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
anything, but I am disgusted. People talk nice to our
faces and laugh at us behind our backs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> Why, cuss ’em. I could buy the whole
caboodle of ’em.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> No, ye couldn’t, Jim. These people have
money, and what’s more, they are used to it, and get
the worth of their money travelin’. We don’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> Worth o’ their money! How does that old
skate git the worth o’ his money who goes trottin’
round with what he calls a <i>vally de shamber</i> to put his
clothes on? Mollie, I never want nobody puttin’ my
clothes on me. Why, it aint decent. When I git as wuthless
as that cuss, I want ’em to take me out an’ lynch me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> But when that man orders anything, the
waiters get it at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> So they do fur us. I plunk down a dollar an’
they git a gait on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> An’ they laugh at ye afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> (<i>Angry.</i>) Laugh at me! How d’ye know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> I’ve overheard them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> Well, there’ll be a dead nigger if they do it
agin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> Jim, you mustn’t talk that way. We can’t
blame ’em. We don’t know how to act, I guess.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> No, Mollie, I reckon we aint in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> Let’s go back home!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> All right. Vance is tired of it, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> Vance tired? Why, he knows how to act.
He’s been with the best.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> He’s sick of it. Goin’ to Europe or some’ers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> Poor Vance! I’m awful sorry. D’ye s’pose
he’ll ever git over that shootin’ of <i>her</i> brother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> No! Say, Mollie (<i>confidentially</i>), I s’pose I
oughtn’t to tell. He asked me not to, but that’s why
he’s goin’ so sudden. He’s so restless, he can’t stay
in one place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> I’m awful sorry fur Vance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> You bet. If I was him I’d get onto that lead
agin or burn some powder. I never seen whiter people
than them Lawtons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> But how could they make up after that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> Old man is A1.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> He doesn’t want to marry the old man!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> No, but I’d have an assay anyway an’ see
if there wasn’t a trace. If the button wasn’t bigger’n a
pin-head I’d foller the lead. As fur the young lady,
she’s all pay streak clean through, an’ a thousand dollars
to the ton, an’ purty as a peach. If I wasn’t taken
a’ready, Mollie—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> Now Jim, don’t be silly. You do say such
things an’ people hear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> Let ’em hear! who cares?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> I s’pose he’s never seen her sence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> Seein’ her would be awful hard to do after
shootin’ her brother before her eyes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> But it was all a terrible mistake, nobody
was to blame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> D’ye think they could ever forgit that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> Mebbe not, but I b’lieve both of ’em
would be better fur havin’ a talk. Vance is too good
an’ true to go dodgin’ anybody.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> That’s what!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> I wish they could meet. She loves him to
death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> D’ye think so, Mollie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> I know it. Why she nearly went out of
her head after the shootin’.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> Why couldn’t I tell him that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> (<i>Emphatically.</i>) Don’t think of such a
thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> Hist, Mollie! (<i>He hears <span class="smcap">Vance</span> coming.</i>)</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Enter</span> <span class="smcap">Vance</span>, D. F.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> Good morning, Mrs. Rogers!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> Good morning, Mr. Vance! I am so glad
to see you. I am so weary of seein’ nobody but strangers
an’ niggers day after day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> I’m very sorry then that I have come to announce
my immediate departure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> So ye’re goin’ to leave us?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> (<i>Sadly.</i>) Yes, I’m sorry, but I—I have
changed my plans.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> Purty sudden, aint it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> Rather! Well, you see, Mrs. Rogers, I’m a
nervous, restless sort of chap. Always was, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> Pard, come back to the mountains with us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> (<i>Surprised.</i>) What! Are you going, too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> Yes, Mollie’s gittin’ tired of society.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> I don’t blame her. Such a hurly-burly, come-and-go
sort of life as this is intolerable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> I can’t bear it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> The Grouse is all tore up about it. Says people
make fun of us. I said let me ketch ’em at it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> (<i>Warningly.</i>) Jim!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> What do I care fur ’em? I pay as I go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> Yes, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> Pay as you go! Just as if money did everything.
They have money an’ edication, we have nothin’
but money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> (<i>Vexed.</i>) Don’t say that, Mrs. Rogers. Taint
so. We have somethin’ else. We’ve horse sense.
That’s more’n that old galoot with the <i>vally de shamber</i>
kin say. An’ look at that arm. Aint that something?
I’ve driv a drill three foot into solid granite in the
Lucy, an’ I kin do it agin. An’ that old gilly an’ his
<i>vally de shamber</i> couldn’t both do that in a week, to
save their necks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> They don’t have to drill holes in rocks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> Well, I’ll drill a hole in the next feller ’at
laughs at you, Mollie. An’ I’ll make it big enough
fur him to put in a skylight. Cuss ’em, what do I care for
Floridy, an’ dudes from down East, an’ gals dressed to
kill. None of ’em as purty as you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> Jim Rogers!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> An’ if some o’ them dudes aint a holy show,
I’ll eat a live alligater.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> I think you are oversensitive, Mrs. Rogers.
You’ll get used to this after a while and like it better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> Harvey Vance, why don’t you like it then?
It’s your own kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> (<i>Uneasy.</i>) Well—in fact I never was much
for show and style, and—in fact it occurred to me to
see Europe while I have a chance. (<i>Going.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> Goin’ to pack up?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vance.</span> Yes. I want to catch the next Savannah
boat. (<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rog.</span> Say Mollie, le’s us pack our traps an’ the

<h3>THE COBBLER.</h3>

<div class="scene">

<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>—<i>A cobbler’s shop. Shoemaker’s bench and kit,
shelves, empty dry goods box, two paper shoe boxes, roll
of leather leaning in corner, lasts hanging on wall, old
shoes scattered about and scraps of leather on floor, old
chair with one leg broken. Bench well down C. so cobbler
can move round freely in shop. Cobbler with apron and
make-up to suit.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Cobbler.</span> (<i>As curtain rises is hammering a piece of
sole leather on his lap stone.</i>) That sole’s got to be jist
right, jist so thick an’ no thicker. It’s fur Lawyer
Boyd and I ’low no more particklerer man lives this side
o’ Jordan. Always kickin’ about something. Said the
last pair o’ shoes I made him didn’t fit anywhere except
on his corns. Was ashamed of ’em every time he
plead a case. Felt humiliated every time he saw ’em.
(<i>Plies hammer vigorously.</i>) Plague take it! I wouldn’t
hurt a lawyer’s feelin’s fur the world, specially <i>his</i>
feelin’s. That man is downright insultin’ in his ways.
Jist because I promised him a pair o’ new shoes last
Thanksgivin’ an’ didn’t git ’em ready till Christmas
he stormed round like a house afire. Said I was worse
’n the tailor an’ <i>he</i> don’t never get anything ready on
time. Some people thinks theirs is the only job in
town. As if a shoemaker wasn’t human an’ consekently
<i>had</i> to fail in his promises <i>sometimes</i>. That old pettifogger
actooally said if I was responsible he’d cane
me. I’d like to see ’im try it. It’s thirty year sence
anybody tried <i>that</i> game on me. But he’s good pay
an’ bin my customer fur thirty odd year. An’ customers
aint none too plenty these days o’ factry shoes. It’s
mostly patchin’ an’ people puttin’ on airs as if they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
was conferrin’ favors lettin’ you patch their old shoes.
Old Boyd has a tongue, though, if he <i>is</i> a gentleman.
Said I want no better’n a tramp printer, an’ a dozen o’
them want worth the price of a glass o’ beer. Durn
him! Cobblin’ is a better business ’n the law any day.
In my day I had the best trade in Illinois. I’ve made
shoes fur judges, an’ generals, yes, an’ fur a president,
<i>too</i>. Made one pair fur Abe Lincoln when he was up
here in ’59 pleadin’ a case. He come in an’, sez he,
“I want a pair o’ kip shoes, make ’em easy!” That was
all the directions. When he come fur ’em they went
on like grease, an’, sez he, “That’s the way <i>I</i> like ’em.”
He didn’t pinch ’em an’ stomp round the shop an’
smell the leather an’ ask if it was split. He wasn’t
that sort. He went away an’ left his old ones an’ like
a fool I throwed ’em away. I’d give a thousand dollars
fur ’em this minnit. No, I wouldn’t. I couldn’t afford
to give one dollar fur ’em, but I ’low there are folks ’at
would.</p>

<p class="direction"><i>Knocking at door. Goes to door and carries on conversation
with one outside. <span class="smcap">Cobbler</span> only is heard.</i></p>

<p>Heh? Minister wants his shoes? They aint done yet.
Promised yisterday. So they was, but my old woman
wasn’t well yisterday afternoon and I had to stay at
home with her. When’ll he git ’em? To-morrow.
Sure? (<i>Testily.</i>) I said to-morrow. (<i>Comes back down
grumbling.</i>) Some people thinks ye kin do everything
at onct. The minister kin write sermons in his slippers,
cordin’ to my tell. Where are his shoes? (<i>Rummages.</i>)
Plague take it. I’m gittin’ forgitfuller every day.
People thinks a shoemaker ought to carry everything
in his mind. Next thing they’ll be wantin’ me to sleep
with their old shoes. (<i>Finds shoes.</i>) Humph! Easy to
tell they was preacher’s shoes. He’s mighty keerful
of ’em. Has to be on his salary, an’ people not a payin’
up prompt. They’ve been blacked an’ blacked till they
aint much left but blackin’ an’ cracks. Not wuth
mendin’ nohow, but I s’pose I’ll have to doctor ’em
up somehow. They ought to be <i>foxed</i> but that’ud cost
mor ’n they’re worth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span></p>

<p class="direction"><i>Throws shoes in pail of water with splash. Takes up
another pair.</i></p>

<p>These are old Mrs. Green’s. Now jist see the
patches! An’ she wants ’em gone over agin. Jacob’s
coat aint a circumstance to <i>her</i> shoes. That woman is
tighter ’n a swelled bung. Last time I patched them
shoes it took half a day an’ I charged her fifty cents coz
I knowed I couldn’t git seventy-five. She said it was
an outrage and cut up like a drunken fiddler till I was
ashamed of her. Said thirty-five cents was a big price
an’ she wouldn’t pay a red cent more. The old skinflint!
(<i>Angrily.</i>) I jist wont fool with them shoes any
more. (<i>Throws them aside.</i>) I don’t care if she does
own half the town. I wouldn’t be in her shoes for half
the earth. I uster want to be rich, but sence I see how
riches has affected old Mrs. Green I’m better satisfied
to be poor. (<i>Noise outside.</i>) What’s all that racket?</p>

<p class="direction"><i><span class="smcap">Cobbler</span> goes to door and looks out.</i></p>

<p>That’s the movin’ wagons. The landlord’s been
sayin’ these fifteen year he’d pull down this old place
and build. I got sorter used to his talk and paid no
attention to the notice. (<i>Feels in his pockets.</i>) Where
is that notice? I’m gittin’ more ’n more forgitful every
day. (<i>Sits on bench.</i>) Thirty odd year in one place an’
then move! I hoped it wouldn’t come in my time.
(<i>Chin on hands.</i>) I made old Judge Henry’s shoes here
an’ I made Gen. Bridge’s boots here, the very pair he
was killed in at Chickamaugy an’ I made Lincoln’s
shoes here. They’re all dead long ago an’ I’m here
yet. Thirty year in one place. It’s jist like movin’
an’ old tree. It’ll most likely dwindle an’ it takes
more coddlin’ than a dozen young ones an’ then if it
lives it’ll never do no great things. But there aint no
use cryin’ over spilt milk. I’ll have to pack up.</p>

<p class="direction"><i>Rises, gets big dry goods box from corner and commences
to sort the old shoes.</i></p>

<p>I ’low half this old truck might as well be burned,
but what a fuss there’d be if some of these trumpery old
things were lost. Old Mrs. Green would—well, I’ll
jist wrap <i>hers</i> up safe and sound. If they got injured I’d<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
have to make her a new pair, nothin’ short of it, an’
then likely she’d want damages for the trouble I caused
her. (<i>Finishes wrapping <span class="smcap">Mrs. Green’s</span> shoes and lays
them up carefully on shelf. Picks up another pair.</i>) Great
Christopher! Here’s a pair of old Mrs. Jink’s shoes
and I promised ’em to-day never thinkin’ of the movin’.
There’ll be music if she don’t git ’em. She’s the only
person in town I don’t dare to disappoint. Tried it
once an’ it lasted me twenty year. Tongue! That
woman could talk down a parrot house any day.
She’s a buzz saw worked by ’lectricity. The old hyena!
Why, that time she wanted to go away visitin’ her
sister’s an’ her shoes wasn’t quite done—such a tongue
lashin’ as I got. I don’t care much for people’s chinnin’
genally. Some I laugh at, an’ some I humor, but
I stood like a stacher before her and dasn’t open my
mouth. There must be sich things as special providences,
fur old man Jinks is deaf as a post.</p>

<p class="direction"><i>Throws some shoes into box. Takes up large pair and
pauses. Looks intently at them.</i></p>

<p>Why, if them aint Col. Sawyer’s shoes. Might a
known ’em by the size, biggest foot in the state I reckon.
He never got any repairin’ done ’cause I had no other
shoes in the shop big enough for his feet to change
into. Canal boats we uster call ’em. Why, the colonel’s
been gone west these ten year. An’ I’m mighty
sorry the town lost him. Soul as big as his feet—his
immortal soul I mean. (<i>Laughs.</i>) He did the town
some good. Always startin’ some enterprise an’ keepin’
it a goin’, too. He didn’t set round till he took root
like some people in this town. He <i>was</i> a customer.
Two pairs of new shoes an’ one pair of boots a year at
ten dollars a pair. An’ no patchin’, ’cause he always
said life was too short to wait fur patches. An’ he
never kicked either if I was a month or so late on
promise. He was a gentleman an’ never tried to browbeat
poor folks.</p>

<p class="direction"><i>Throws shoes in box. Takes up another pair.</i></p>

<p>Farmer Snooks! (<i>Laughs heartily.</i>) By ginger! that
was funny. (<i>Laughs till he holds his sides.</i>) Made that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
pair for Snooks an’ agreed to take it in trade. Fust
thing I knowed, one night when I went home, I found
a wagon load o’ turnips in the cellar. Mariar was hot
but she’s one o’ them kind ’at never says much. Says
she, “Cy, what on airth did you buy so many turnips
fur?” Sez I, “I vum if I know. I told Snooks I’d take
trade, but I guess I clean forgot to say what kind o’
trade.” Mariar she never said no more but jist cooked
turnips every day fur about two months. Of course I
dasn’t say nothin’, till one day she got dreadful pained
an’ sick, an’ the doctor had to come on the run. He
said she was threatened with dropisy, an’ I jist fed the
rest o’ them turnips to the pigs. They kin work their
spoiled truck off on the minister an’ the editor, for they
can’t help theirselves, but they don’t work it off on me
no more.</p>

<p class="direction"><i>Takes up another pair.</i></p>

<p>By jingo, there’s an old shoe of Jake Hart’s. Know
it by the way he always run ’em down. I ’low they’re
not any worse run down than Jake was. Poor feller,
didn’t he go to the dogs after his mother left him a fortune?
Want a nicer woman in town than Mrs. Hart.
But she died at the right time. Poor Jake! Best hearted
feller ye ever see. I made the first pair of boots he
ever had when he wasn’t higher than that. (<i>Holds hand
to show height.</i>) His mother fetched him in. He spied a
piece of red morocco; he would have that fur tops in spite
of her. Jake painted everything red. Races, whiskey,
bad company, an’ then shootin’ that man. Guess the
man needed shootin’, but Jake had to vamoose. I wonder
where he is now? Nobody’ll ever know I reckon.
It’s always that way in this world, we aint missed long.</p>

<p class="direction"><i>Opens an old shoe box.</i></p>

<p>What’s this? (<i>Brushes off dust, reads, “Nellie Blake.”</i>)
Well I vum! I didn’t know that any of Nellie Blake’s
shoes was here yit. (<i>Muses.</i>) What’ll I do with <i>them</i>?
I can’t throw <i>them</i> away. She was the best girl that
ever lived in this town. There aint many angels anywhere
on earth, I ’low, but Nellie was one if there be
any. I wonder if she would have changed if she’d have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
lived? No I guess she’d be the same to-day. Her an’
Jake Hart was good friends. Jined yards an’ played
together. Jake went among the best then. People said
he liked Nellie, fur after she died he seemed all broke
up like, an’ went away with his mother to travel. I
wonder if I ought to send them shoes to her mother? I
don’t know, mebbe it would please her, seein’ Nellie
was an only child. No, I guess it might do more harm
than good. (<i>With feeling.</i>) I know what that is. I
have a little pair of shoes out at the toes that I dasn’t
show Mariar, though I know she has things of our little
Jack hid away. (<i>Gets out little shoes. Looks at them fondly,
wipes his glasses with handkerchief.</i>) These durn specs
is gittin’ so I can’t see nothin’. Our little Jack! I kin
see him now, runnin’ down the street to call me to dinner.
He was the youngest and we took to him more
than to tothers. I’ll lay away Nellie’s shoes and keep
them along with Jack’s. They was friends, too. (<i>Wipes
glasses.</i>) My specs seems awful dusty. (<i>Looks fondly
at shoes as he puts them away.</i>) Jack is waitin’ fur Mariar
an’ me. It wont be very long now till we’ll see him.</p>

<p>The publisher believes that he can
say truthfully that Denison’s list of
plays is on the whole the best selected
and most successful in the
market. <i>New Plays</i> will be added
from time to time.</p>

<p><i>Manuscripts</i>, not only of plays but
of any books similar to those in Denison’s
catalogue, will receive careful
attention and if accepted will be
paid for at current prices.</p>

distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
